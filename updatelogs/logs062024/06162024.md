# 6/16/2024 - 10th Update!

Ok, so I appear to have seen a higher dimension after drawing blood... (is that what you call it? idk, basically some blood test or something) (i also couldn't hear a little, but now I'm better!)

So, here's a little update from the car, as both my hands hurt (yes, they had to try both hands, my blood is oddly slow at moving?)

Ideas: 
- Only updating when needed (well, that's kind of obvious)
- We can sacrifice a bit of memory to store partially already-calculated version of the screen that the code believes will be used frequently, so we don't need to recalculate
- Some mix of idea 1 and 2?
- Store a lot of the assets needed as images (maybe numpy arrays? or convert then while booting up?), so we won't need to create them from nothing
- Everything should be an array until the end!!! (So image -> array -> maths and storing and stuff -> array -> image)

Well, that's a little update from the car, hopefully I remember to `git pull` later...

Ok, I'm on the computer now!

Here are a bit more optimizations we can do:
- Sacrifice storage space for converted images (i will likely add some option to clear all saved or delete some saved)
- Use .json for "projects"
- Use UUIDs to identify which images are in each project
- Probably have a temporary file for each session?
- Probably have a loading screen...

Well, just made a loading screen!

Ah, NYC is always beautiful! Anyways, coding time! The window is now 1366x697, since that is my display size without Windows' little thing on the top and bottom. I also realized that we can also sacrifice a bit of our UI design and split the UI into multiple images, and do this similarly to the optimization of only updating regions that need it. 

This is the point where I realized, this should instead be made as a website, not an app. Whatever! So, a bit of UI redesign, instead of cramming everything into a page, it'll be split into 3 tabs! Here's a pixelated version, since I don't feel like pasting 3 images in:

This should make it easier for ttk work!

Ok, I imported the Comfortaa font (how many times have I downloaded it?) from Google Fonts. (wait, I know I downloaded Comfortaa many times before...). Anyways, that's currently there, the license and stuff is inside the zip file, which came from Google Fonts. There's also some basic code in main.py, I'm planning on playing around with it tommorow for the interface! 

Oh yeah, one more thing: we also need to write a bit of code for rotations in pathing...

Good night!
