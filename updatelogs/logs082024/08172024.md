# 8/17/2024 - 46th Update!

im back! what happened yesterday? so i kinda felt sick (my head was hurting), so didnt do much programming yesterday (i did, however, CAD two gears, built it in real life, and realized that i did something wrong). anyways, back in business!

before continuing, i wonder if there is some tk widget for these sprites, that behave like labels... gonna do some research! ok, so just asked the omniscient AI, they provided an approach that uses canvases, basically what we're doing (and i remember canvases... we're not doing that!) ok, so back to working on the update region thingy...

ok, drew up this simple thing for pseduocode, basically, update the regions that are in the old frame's position, and the new frame's position, or if the sprite changes a property (we can also constantly schedule it, but only actually process stuff when time is changed, but again, properties can be edited while paused...)

ok, let me write the things i need to do (because, i still am feeling sick and eepy):
- translate images to regions affected, given size and position
- schedule regions (old and new)
- remember old region data (probably should just store it in the sprite...)

ok, encountering a strange math issue. lazy me would just multiply it, but math me wants to make this unnccesarily complicated

![ok](</updatelogs/images/082024/08172024 - 2.png>)

so, the normal approach to find the image size would be "just process it like normal", but i think thats slow and, instead, i'd like to be unneccesarily complicated to make it "faster" (idk how noticable). the only things we care about that affect image size is `setSize()` and `rotateDegHundred()` (ignore that all clear transparency technically makes the region size it affects 0)

im gonna make a quite commit, because i may mess up... 

ok, so the distance of each point should stay constant to the center, since we are rotating, (ignoring size/scaling for now)

ok, i think i simulated rotating in demsmos! (ah, who else loves punching random numbers until it works?)

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08172024 - 3.png>)

ok, added some more stuff, go look at the calculator here! https://www.desmos.com/calculator/brjkynajvn

should be good? testing now! huh its phasing in and out of reality... ok, it shuold be working now! i realized that a problem that keeps causing it to update the screen is that we may be setting the point data when we're not touching any points? will probably have to optimize that next...

ok, things should be better? we still need to do the old data stuff, since we're still basing the update off the new changed data, which doesnt make sense. ok, it should have been solved in a nice way, testing...

ok, we are getting very quirky behavior... ok, so it seems like after flipping the update order ((schedule, then render) to (render, then schedule)) and changing a couple goofy things, it seems to be working properly? it seems to also be updating when data is changed! however, it still gets scheduled, and i suspect this is because we are setting point data consistently? ok, ive found it (i think?) line 662 of `interface.py`! ok, yes yes yes! appears to be working now!

ok, so today was pretty decent! got a couple optimizations working! now, it does break the coordinate path (property 1) rendering (with the giant orange orbs and path), so that needs to be fixed... (it just doesnt show up)

anyways, that's it for me today, good night!
