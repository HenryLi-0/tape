# 6/21/2024 - 15th Update!

~~oh look its the funny number~~

anyways, how was your day? this morning, i did robotics stuff. coming home, i nearly broke my legs again (yes, i did it again, i jumped from 5 feet straight into concrete. turns out, even if you put your toes out to absorb the impact, they do nothing and the force goes straight into your heels. now my right heel is hurting when i use it to walk. yes, i am walking digitigrade at home (don't laugh im have reasons! lol). and tommorows our robotics competition...)

anyways, todays going to be a small update, basically a little testing of `fonts.py` and testing out FPS. We also have mouse coordinate detection! I'm getting a rough 18-20 FPS when displaying the mouse position on the screen and 50 random characters (that one liner from 6/17/2024 was useful here!) and an FPS display. Now, since I programmed in Scratch for many years, I am ok with 15-30 FPS, since Scratch is pretty slow sometimes. Of course, some people probably don't appreciate the low FPS count, but this can be fixed with more efficient rendering. or they can just get a super beefy computer (i, in fact, do NOT have a super super beefy computer, but i am ok with low FPS).

anyways, im going to let my foot rest before tommorow, and im going to draw something.
