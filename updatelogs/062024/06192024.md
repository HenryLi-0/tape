# 6/19/2024 - 13th Update!

Ok, so tommorrow's the Chemistry Regents... anyways, today was basically editing this storage system. So, `bay.py` has been upgraded into OOP (joke, well, actually, maybe). `CacheManager()` is now a new object for managing the all the files and stuff. We also have a "this image can't be found" image! It was a little annoying to write and test, but it should be self explanatory by reading `bay.py`!

Here's what happened: 
- `cache.txt` no longer stores everything. This is because I had a 16MB `cache.txt` for a single, 0.47MB image
- `/storage/` now stores `UUID.npy` arrays
- `cache.txt` has been repurposed as a list (not a dictionary) that keeps track of all images that it thinks exists

and yeah, that's about it for now (i think? i am pretty forgetful...)

ok, after taking a half hour nap, i realized that we can do a bit more to make less "image not found" messages appear. So, we can save the image paths in the cache (which means changing it into a dictionary...) so that, incase the storage system is erased (not including the cache), we can still easily look for paths, and if the path doesn't exist, we then delete it from `cache.txt`

A little update:
- `cache.txt` has been re-repurposed as a dictionary (not a list) that keeps track of all image UUIDs that it thinks exists along with their paths!

Ok, after eating a couple pistachios, it seems to work! Ok, now a bit of documentation. 

Ok, it's the afternoon now. I decided to spent time programming instead of drawing art this afternoon. So, UI time! I'm starting to get tired of walls of text as the updatelogs!

IMPORTANT UPDATE: The screen size has been changed from `1366x697` to `1366x698` so that both are even numbers and can be centered nicely. This won't matter, as there will be extra space on the outside anyway. But just a heads up.

Now, here's a painful image I had to create. Yes, everything wasn't aligned perfectly before, now it should be better. Now, we should have (near) perfect measurements for our UI!

- Animation Interface: `(23,36) to (925,542)`: size `(903,507)`
- Timeline Interface: `(23,558) to (925,680)`: size `(903,123)`
- Editor Interface: `(953,36) to (1340,542)`: size `(388,507)`
- Options Interface: `(953,558) to (1340,680)`: size `(388,123)`
- Entire Screen: `(0,0) to (1365,697)`: size `(1366,698)`

ok, so now, it's basically a work of putting this UI information in! Currently, the options interface is making me think to much now, so I'll just put it as a box with the words "FIX" for now.

A silly first UI! Yes, I realize that I need to center this and that the colors are incorrect. It will get fixed, trust! Ok, so the theme creator appears to be working right now. However, the UI does not seem to be appearing in the tk window very well, so that'll need some fixing. However, it is 11 PM and I have my Chemistry Regents tommorow. I, in fact, did not study at all. Let's see how this plays out... Oh yeah, we also have a new `/subsystems/checks.py` for checking that everything is good before the program goes!

Good night everyone! (wow, today was really productive!)
