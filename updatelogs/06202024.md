*vine boom sound effect* 

hello! guess what i found today... somethings not right here...:

`FRAME_OPTIONS = Image.open(os.path.join("resources", "themed", "u_frame_editor.png")).convert("RGBA")`

why is that looking at `/resources/themed/u_frame_editor.png` when it is `FRAME_OPTIONS` (keyword: OPTIONS)? the effects of copying and pasting your own code... Anyways, the UI looks correct now! So, I think the next goal is to center it properly! Here's my idea, freshly made! (well, it was the idea all along) Using the tk grid feature thingy! We're going to have useless things in the grid just to make it look nice! Also, I'm planning to make a fan out of toilet paper, alumnium foil, tape, glue, and a couple rubber bands. ~~And maybe some forehead oil for a lubricant~~. (just kidding, alumnium foil should slide against itself well. it might not be neccesary...) 

Anyways, back to UI! A couple updates with `window.py`, taking inspiration from some FRC team code (not ours), the (important/major) widgets will now start with `w_{widget name}` now. (ok, i know that we are really against shoving unneccesary things at the start of variables in FRC code, but I expect `window.py` to have a lot of code and variables, so just incase...) (im sorry my amazing programming heads) Anyways, jokes aside, back to UI things. The widgets no longer have the silly bright grey border around them, so that's good!

Ok, with some research, it seems that using spacer images is a bad idea, and that using `padx` and `pady` when setting up the position is better. Now, look at that UI!

wow so cool! anyways, that was way too little work for ~2.25 hours of coding, it mostly just went to bug fixing and research and stuff. 

Also, today, I had the genius idea of slamming my foot straight into concrete from a pretty high jump (probably around 5 feet?). Usually, I can easily jump from up to 8 staircases, but that's with using my arm to assist with the landing. Also, instead of landing on my toes like usual, I slammed the heel of my foot STRAIGHT into the concrete! It didn't hurt after a while, but now at 11PM, my leg hurts when I move it in some positions. Uh oh! Anyways, trying not to move my legs much so that they don't break anymore (please help), I'm going to try to wake up tommorow with working legs so I can help with robotics testing. Good night!
