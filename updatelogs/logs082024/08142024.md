# 8/14/2024 - 44th Update!

feels good to be back! if you didn't know, i was away for like 3 weeks working on [Protoplop](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/protoplop) (a totally original idea about drawing). however, i am now back to continue work on Tape! It's the middle of August now, and I hope to be able to finish what I plan in less than a week (hopefully). Anyways, what are we here for?

- Window Optimizations: Upgrade `window.py` to work better
- Better Looking Code: Some code is repeated, instead of having functions
- Upgrade Code: Protoplop was built on top of the original Tape window system, and has improved on it! Tape should be upgraded with these improvements!
- Interface Optimizations: Improve a lot of stuff such as:
    - how Interactive Visual Objects is set up on initalization (having permanent keys for the objects that always stay on screen, instead of scanning the full list everytime to look for it)
    - Only updating things when neccesary
- Looks: Better UI!!! We got so many new Visual Objects!!!
- Finish Up: Finish/polish up anything that I didn't finish!

ok, gonna make a new branch to do this in! new branch made, lets pull up protoplop and gets started! ok, first things first, (why is java activating???), gonna compare the old and new `render.py`

wow, just found a long time bug...
