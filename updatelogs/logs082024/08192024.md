broke a couple things, but it should now be fixed! ok, icons are done! bug fixing time! hmm, still have no clue how to fix the point connections bug... (not related to that bug, but) also, got rid of the keybind cooldowns for the timeline and graphs! ok, so idk, but i dont think my fixes work. it does seem, however, that pressing left control updates it correctly??? im gonna commit real quick
