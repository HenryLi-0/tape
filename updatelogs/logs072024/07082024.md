# 7/8/2024 - 31st Update!

ok, today's the start of my busy schedule. its currently 12:33 AM, and i've decided that im gonna try to plan. here's the task list: 
- create special case for coordinate path editor
- multiple sprites!!!
- (consider the timeline done FOR NOW, we still need to add that play button...)

if you didn't read yesterday's log, i didn't finish in time for a pre-release, so that day will hopefully be tuesday evening! (gives be two extra days to finish these simple things can clean up) this pace tells me that the actual release might actually be next week. now, this is horrible, as i am aiming to build two other big code things before the end of summer (both are silly). this means we need a real plan.

To-do: (defintely will get delayed)
- 7/6/2024 - DONE - fix that weird bug with the point that appears and is doing nothing
- 7/6/2024 - DONE - get connections editor going (like connections between the lines, linear or smooth/bezier)
- 7/7/2024 - DONE - timeline (simple, will finish)
- 7/8/2024 - create special case for coordinate path editor
- 7/9/2024 - multiple sprites!!!
- 7/10/2024 - sprite ordering (this can wait for next release)
- 7/10/2024 - exporting projects to video (very silly, but it can wait for next release)
- 7/11/2024 - apperance importing (this can wait for next release)
- 7/12/2024 - open/save projects (can wait for next release)

ok, its the actual morning now! we're taking turns teaching, and its not my turn right now, so i'm gonna code! coordinate coordinate editor time! ok so turns out i cant really multitask coding and teaching... anyways, im gonna be forced to go to some place from 6-7/8PM, so im gonna probably be outside from 5-8/9PM, so i dont have much time to work today! ok, update at 9:47 PM, uh... i fell asleep this afternoon... oops. gonna quickly head to a robotics meeting and hopefully code later. if not, today would be a planning day! (well i am just make excuses now, aren't i?) now, it'ss 11 PM, and im letting my head cool down by sitting next to the air conditioner! coding time!

ok, showing little related path orbs are working! (they're not editable yet) the orbs are currently too big, gonna shrink the size from 96px by 96px to 50px by 50px. a little bug, you can change the graph scale while editing points and points dont move, so changing scale while selecting a point is diabled. it appears this bug also moves the entire path when selecting a point and moving the graph offset, so that is also disabled. ok, keybinds to edit points now!

12:26 AM update, ITS WORKING!!!

![YAY](</updatelogs/images/072024/07092024 - 1.png>)

hold "D" to move points! now its debugging time! also, pressing "Control_L" has the same function of "sumbitting" as "Return" (i still think it should be called "Enter"...)! this is to make it faster to edit, as a lot of the deafult keybinds are on the left side of the keyboard! its now 12:31 AM, and i have to get up early tommorow to be in two meetings at the same time (using two computers)... anyways, one more task done!

To-do: (defintely will get delayed)

- 7/7/2024 - DONE - timeline (simple, will finish)

why did i save the hardest for last? anyways, good night!
