# 6/11/2024 - 6th Update!

Ok, after accidentally CADing for 3 hours yesterday, I'm back on the project! Today, I've implemented the math and its working great!!!

Here's a picture of this beauty!

Ok, so I basically reused the incorrect path code and edited a lot of it and it now works with the new way we're doing things! Unlike last time, which relied on calculating the intersection of two lines that represented a part of the curve, it already calculates the points, so we don't need to calculate for intersections! I also decided to make the code a little less pretty for the benefit of a questionable speed boost. Even so, the pathing for 3 coordinates is going at a speed of ~$0.001$ seconds per test, sometimes even as low as ~$0.0009$ seconds! At that point, it doesn't really matter. However, let's try with 100 coordinates!

New code: `1000 tests | avg: 0.02540440249443054 seconds`
Old code: `1000 tests | avg: 0.03022300934791565 seconds`

Looks like the new version is better in these tests! (I'm too lazy to run more, it'll be ok...). For the actual program, it might be best to have a setting for generating path outlines. For optimizations, the paths will probably only be calculated during/after editing, and when saving. The settings will probably be:

- Every tick (every chance it gets when editing a path)
- Every x ticks (every x ticks when editing a path)
- When done editing (when the path is finished editing)
- Button (when the button is pressed, all paths are generated)
- Saving (will likely always be on) (when file is saved)

Also, upon reviewing test results, it seems that I am unable to do the fancy maths of this stuff. After more research, I realized that I misread a little part about points, so time to add another section!

Here's a bit from ChatGPT! Yes, I had to reformat the math equations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have two quadratic Bézier curves:

1. The first curve $P_0(t)$ with control points $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_2$.
2. The second curve $P_1(t)$ with control points $B_0$, $B_1$, and $B_2$.

To join these curves smoothly, you need to ensure:

1. $C^{0}$ continuity: $A_2=B_0$ (the end of the first curve is the start of the second curve).
2. $C^{1}$ continuity: $B_1=2A_2-A_1$ (the tangents at the join point are equal).

Thus, \( A_0 \) is simply the starting point of the first quadratic Bézier curve, and similarly, $B_0$ is the starting point of the second quadratic Bézier curve. These points play a crucial role in defining the position and shape of the Bézier curves.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now I'm going to replace these coordinates with $A_1$ to $A_3$ instead of $A_0$ to $A_2$. So, in theory, we only need: [$A_1$, $A_2$ (control), $B_1$ ($A_3=B_1$), $B_2$ (control), ...]

and we know that $A_2$ is $A_1$, and that $B_2$ is $2A_3 - A_2$, or, with our setup, $2B_1 - A_2$, so:

[$A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ , $2B_1 - A_2$, ...]

Now, for a random test set! $\left[\left(0,0\right),\left(0,10\right),\left(10,10\right),\left(20,0\right),\left(10,-10\right),\left(30,-20\right),\left(0,-20\right),\left(-20,0\right),\left(-20,10\right),\left(0,-10\right)\right]$

and now it actually works! Time to test the code's speed! 

`1000 tests | avg: 0.02389969778060913 seconds` (still pretty good! it's not like we're going to calculate paths at max FPS, that's a waste of computational power... unless you want to...)
