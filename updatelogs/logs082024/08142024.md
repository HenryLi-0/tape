# 8/14/2024 - 44th Update!

feels good to be back! if you didn't know, i was away for like 3 weeks working on [Protoplop](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/protoplop) (a totally original idea about drawing). however, i am now back to continue work on Tape! It's the middle of August now, and I hope to be able to finish what I plan in less than a week (hopefully). Anyways, what are we here for?

- Window Optimizations: Upgrade `window.py` to work better
- Better Looking Code: Some code is repeated, instead of having functions
- Upgrade Code: Protoplop was built on top of the original Tape window system, and has improved on it! Tape should be upgraded with these improvements!
- Interface Optimizations: Improve a lot of stuff such as:
    - how Interactive Visual Objects is set up on initalization (having permanent keys for the objects that always stay on screen, instead of scanning the full list everytime to look for it)
    - Only updating things when neccesary
- Looks: Better UI!!! We got so many new Visual Objects!!!
- Finish Up: Finish/polish up anything that I didn't finish!

ok, gonna make a new branch to do this in! new branch made, lets pull up protoplop and gets started! ok, first things first, (why is java activating???), gonna compare the old and new `render.py`

wow, just found a long time bug...

ok, the new `render.py` seems to be working! ok, quick commit before things break... ok, i think the next move is splitting `fancy.py` into two files... (amazing split screen setup! (with a video playing in the background!)) ok, the file should be split now! ok, i guess next is possibly adding in the new label wrapper! again, quick commit!

ok, finally got the new label wrapper working, now, time to start updating the themed stuff! (we have way too many images in resources) but quick commit! wait actually, before this, we should rename things in `settings.py`. oh right, and the the most important update for FPS i forgot about was removing the waiting! wow, went from 20 to 30 FPS!

wow, we still need to update the typing system too... and the keybinds system! ok, made the text box thingy better, this reminds me i do need to update the visual objects, then i also need to figure out what i had to fix, and also update the keybinds stuff... ok, keybinds have been changed to lambdas, gotta fix this in the code! ok, it should be working now! gonna test a more complicated keybind just to be sure! ok, seems to be working, gonna quickly add some docs... done! now, im gonna check on some of the new visual objects and copy some over... but first, a commit!

ok, these have been updated, a couple things have been changed! (such as keepInFrame getting minX and minY, textboxes looking a bit better, and calculated RGBA values in settings to help with redundant recalculating) ok, i dont remember how i fixed it, but typing is a bit too speedy... i have no clue how to fix it, ill check protoplop commit history...

do the themed stuff!!!
