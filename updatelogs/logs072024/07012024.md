# 7/1/2024 - 24th Update!

ok, even though its not spring, `tape/updatelogs/` REALLY needs a clean up! the images folder now is sorted by month, and logs are also sorted by months! (now, we should be good for like two years, hopefully i finish most development by then!) anyways, today's one of the last days before ~~pain~~ tutoring (i am getting tutored) starts and then my entire busy schedule starts, so let's make this count!

while eating breakfast today, i realized that it would be really annoying if the sprite only had one image, so you would have to create a new sprite for every single thing. so, i realized it would be a good idea to have multiple images/appearances that can be changable through time (so another property!)

ok, sprites support multiple images IN THEORY (we haven't tested it yet), most sprite logic seems good (in theory), and getting/generating full states are done! `generateFullSequence()` and `getFullStateAt()` are in `sprite.py`'s `SingleSprite` now!
