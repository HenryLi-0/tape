# 7/5/2024 - 28th Update!

ok, its currently 1 AM and im motivated (however, i may be more productive the more sleep deprived i am...) anyways, heres a to do list:

- fix that weird bug with the point that appears and is doing nothing
- get connections editor going (like connections between the lines, linear or smooth/bezier)
- create special case for coordinate path editor
- apperance importing (this can wait for next release)
- multiple sprites!!!
- sprite ordering (this can wait for next release)
- timeline (for time things, simple version for now, but more features and details for next release)
- open/save projects (can wait for nezt release)
- exporting projects to video (very silly, but it can wait for next release)

why wait for next release? well, i only have roughly 3 hours of work time (i think?) for this release before any additional hours that i work on it fall into some weird misunderstanding of rules. basically, i need to create a MVP (miminal viable product) for this early test release, so we can continue working on more detailed stuff while making my hours still count (at least, thats how i interpreted the rules?)

anywayd, assuming im motivated when i wake up, exciting things to work on! see you in the morning!

i keep accidentlaly falling asleep for an hour and waking up. good afternoon! just woke up after an unexpected nap, and fixed a weird bug where points would slowly disappear and lead to a crash after resorting the order of points by time multiple times. it also appears that in my attempts to fix this by adding `-1` everywhere, i accidentally created the weird point? oh i just realized that that was very silly. range(10) goes from 0 to 9, not 0 to 10. oh. oops.

connections editor time, we don't have much time... visual object made, finishing logic and preparing for testing... yeah thats a lot of debugging.

ok, so its been a while and it seems that its rendering properly!!!

also something great, just this evening, i recieved some Hack Club stickers in the mail!!! thanks! (they're cool!) now, you can't edit the connection just yet, but its planned! (as in, linear/smooth)
