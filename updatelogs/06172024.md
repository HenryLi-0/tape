# 6/17/2024- 11th Update!

Ok, exciting update! Text rendering is working! There are going to be 3 font sizes, all based on Comfortaa: small, medium, and large (ok, what did you expect lol). 

Quick interruption, I wrote a very good looking and working one liner that generates a string of random text: `text = "".join([x for x in [("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()-_=+")[random.randrange(0,75)] for x in range(100)]])` 

Anyways, here are the test results! Currently, large text is at size 32, medium at 15, and small at 10. 
- Large: `1000 tests | avg: 0.00702945351600647 seconds`
- Medium: `1000 tests | avg: 0.0032306063175201417 seconds`
- Small: `1000 tests | avg: 0.0024291331768035887 seconds`

Pretty good! We won't have to render large text much, I'm planning on probably only needing to render any text element (except user changeable things like statistics and names and values and things) once, so this shouldn't be a huge issue. We do, however, need to create a system to quickly read and save these temporary text elements. I think it would be a good idea to ship the project with an already generated file of common text elements, probably in `resources/`. Most large text will probably not be changed, so that's good. 

There's also now an FPS counter in `window.py`!
