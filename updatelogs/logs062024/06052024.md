# 6/5/2024 - 2nd Update!

Ok, nothing much today! Apologies for the excessive grammar update commits by the way!

The `beizer` function has been changed to `beizerL` (for line) and a new function `beizerMB` (for y=mx+b) has been introduced. The plan is to make it easier to calculate the intersection of two lines with two `(m,b)` instead of two lambdas. Also, speaking of which, there's a new `intersect` function that takes in two lines in `(m,b)` for and returns the intersection as in the `(x,y)` format!

Also, I've been thinking of creating an icon for this program, but I'll need to get better at digital art first...

Next step seems to be the part that is pretty simple but I don't feel like doing. (I will have to though.) It should be relatively simple as it's basically taking in 3 points in `(x,y)` form, doing some maths with all the functions we have (honesty, it'll likely mostly be just `beizerL`, `beizerMB`, and `intersect`), and return a list of `(x,y)` points! I plan to use the little percentage math that we did (the variable $u$ was the percent in the previous log's math) to be able to let the user control how fine the curve is (basically, split the beizer curve into a number of parts). When all the animation stuff is there, this will likely default to the animation's FPS! (We won't need to calculate 60 points for a second if we can only show 30 frames each second!)

Ok, long wall of text over, good night everyone!
