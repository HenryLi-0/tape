# 7/10/2024 - 33rd Update!

ok, so they forced me to review 22 questions in like half an hour for the students. im sorry, its early in the morning, and ive been forced to, sorry not sorry for the half hour of monotone rambling. anyways, the real teacher is now teaching, lets get coding! if i recall correctly, we have bug fixing and demo release today! (and possible a user manual?)

oh yeah, we also have:
- 7/10/2024 - sprite ordering (this can wait for next release)
- 7/10/2024 - exporting projects to video (very silly, but it can wait for next release)

just finished the user manual, not really a manual, just keybinds for now (they'll figure it out, right...) but yeah, planning fix this bug and then release a demo, then continue working on the steps to the real release.

its now 5PM and i can summarize the last two hours with "oops fell asleep". i need to stop laying down on beds... im gonna get some freezing cold water to wake up now. anyways, debugging time (please dont fall asleep again!)

`selectiveBeizierPathCoords()` should hopefully be working now? fixing whatever monstrosity `findStateThroughPath()` is. i think its working!!! yippee! demo release time!
