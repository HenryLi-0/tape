# 7/13/2024 - 35th Update!

i think i broke the streak then (19 days if i dont excuse the competition day, 27 if i do, thats pretty cool!) anyways, back on topic, we have a project to finish!

new plan, of course it can (and likely will) change:
- 7/13/2024 - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - save projects
- 7/15/2024 - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/16/2024 - exporting projects to video

im expecting the actual release to take one more week, but its getting there... at the same time, im planning on starting my next major coding project! also, i have robotics work now, so i need to plan for that as well... (wow my summer just got two times busy...)

ok, its morning time, 10:30 AM here in rainy New York (quite pleasant looking) and in our programming i have programming now (get it? like tv station programming? sorry.)

unfortunately, for exporting projects to videos, my brain couldn't think of anything, even with 2AM energy. however, it did think of this joke:

```
What type of glass is easily angered?
Tempered Glass!
```

there is now a trash can button but clicking it strangely selects sprites in the background? idk why this is happening, but ok. 

"how many parts of the ui will be interacted through scrolling?"

"yes."

just did some apperance panel work! its still a bit broken though
