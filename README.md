# Tape

## Note:

Tape just had its first real release! There'll probably be tons of bugs, so create an issue if you find any!

## Goal:

Issue: No editing software I have can easily move solid images around the screen

**Normal Solution:** Download an editing software with this capability and test it out

**My Solution:** Decide to make a video editor

One option is clearly better here, you decide which... (clearly the second one) (joke) (not really)

Ok, time to get started!

### Getting Started:

First, make sure you have all the neccesary python modules to run this! (Any modules that don't come with python are listed below!) Then, download the latest release from the releases tab, and run `main.py`! Check `MANUAL.md` for a longer user manual on how to use this, and check `CODEGUIDE.md` if you're interested in where to find code!

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
- cv2 (openCV2)
