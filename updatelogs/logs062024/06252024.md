# 6/25/2024 - 18th Update!

Ok, a couple updates

So, after programming in Java for a while, here's my opinions: I like Python's syntax a bit more than Java's but I love how you can make one liners in Java. I also like how variables can be really nicely "globalized" instead of passing it everywhere. However, I don't like how Java syntax feels a little verbose. Also, Java's way of lists is a slight nightmare (POV: python programmer talks about a fixed size for lists). So, a conclusion is that I'm kind of split between Java's and Python's way of programming, but I'll stick to Python as I have more experience in it! (this was an unneccesary rant about java vs python, but whatever lol)

Also, I was today days old when I found out you can do this: `def waitWhat(x): return x+1`. I know. crazy. (note: you will see an increase of one liners.)

Hello everyone! Today I figured out that my idiotic choices have led me to put the mouse active obeject selection detector to constatly set itself to -999 (none) because it does that in the tick() section. I spent an entire hour fixing random things for this.

Anyways, a bit of work later:

![woohoo](</updatelogs/images/062024/06252024 - 1.png>)

some rough path editor!

so, after a long time of debugging the most silliest of mistakes, it seems that I may have an idea of how to render this nicely and make sense in the code! my idea is to store all renderable things into two lists, interactable and noninteractable. each should be designed to be similar to others like them, but the interactable can be modified by mouse actions, and the noninteractable are just rendering jobs. anyways, i think i have an idea of what to do now! unfortuantely, it is almost midnight, so I'm gonna head off to spend time on my phone in bed until 1 AM.

good night!

ok, quick update, turns out ive been spelling interactable with two r's inside basically everywhere in the code oops, quick spelling fix!
