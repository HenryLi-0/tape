# 7/16/2024 - 38th Update

as i have to teach and tutor a kid every single day and do a bunch of teaching stuff, my will to live is slowly decreasing (no way i spent 3.5 hours this afternoon on youtube before realizing it)

hows everyone doing? hopefully well! its coding time! ok, theres now a save button and a place to save, and a screen that pops up to save! thats great!

ok, its been a while, connected saving to the interface with a new save button icon!

the load button icon may look a little familiar... (yes, i flipped the arrow upside down. or right side up?) loading might be good, just need to wire things up. ok, all wired up! testing... saving is working... oh loading crashed... three more crashes and we just loaded in! yes! now its bug hunting time...
