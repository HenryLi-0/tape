# 7/15/2024 - 37th Update

ok, so my plan from yesterday did not happen, as i was unexpectedly told to teach ELA and its hard to code while your student is not understanding math. its practice for a no-calculator test, and i think my student was using one... (you would say 1/3, not 0.33333?) (oh boy someone has to teach them exponents again...)

anyways, coding time! my 1 AM self thought about storing projects inside here themself, so i guess thats what we're doing! `/tape/projects/`! (i just thought of calling the projects "tapes", as in like video tapes, but `/tape/tapes/` seems a bit confusing... but i really like it...) ok, i've decided to rename it `/tape/tapes/`! it may be confusing, but it'll be in the code guide!

by the way, its 10 PM and my legs hurt a lot for some reason (totally not because i speed walked for like three miles...) unfortunately, not much work today, as i had to spend the entire afternoon learning about invasive species:

renamed a couple constants and added `KB_` to the start of keybind variables (this should make it clear what are keybinds), should be able to do more tommorow!

to-do:
- 7/13/2024 - DONE - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - DONE-ish - save projects
- 7/16/2024 - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/17/2024 - exporting projects to video
- 7/18/2024 - polish up and UI stuff
- 7/19/2024 - hopefully release?

i really need to finish this soon, as i have another project similar to this that i want to start! good night!
