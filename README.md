"Timed Animation Production Engine"

## Goal:

Issue: No editing software I have can easily move solid character images around the screen

**Normal Solution:** Download an editing software with this capability and test it out

**My Solution:** Decide to make a video editor

One option is clearly better here, you decide which. (joke)

Ok, time to get started!

### A couple things to do:

- Smooth Paths
- Simple Rotation (not moving)
- Paths with Rotation (moving)
- Particles (explode, confetti, and other effects)
- Simple GUI (options, timing, etc.) (probably block/node based)
- Simple GUI (for paths) (bezier points, path editor)
- Fancy GUI (graphs, lines, etc.)
- Some silly logo
