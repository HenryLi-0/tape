# 7/18/2024 - 40th Update!

- 7/18/2024 - polish up and UI stuff
- 7/19/2024 - hopefully release?

ok, polish up and UI stuff, i guess the first thing is adding editable data in the projects tab! (that fish song is still stuck in my head... its not bad, but its too catchy!) hopefully i can do some bug testing today! 

*proceeds to spend the entire afternoon watching a series of random videos and then attends meetings and realizes there is a bunch of homework/work to do*

ok im going outside for a second, we're really pushing all this work to tonight huh? ok its 9 at night now...

ok, exporting now saves to a file with `*.tape` file extension (hopefully no other programs out there use that file extension), but its basically a text file in disguise! (theres kind of no need for this except maybe orginization, but you know, gotta make it look fancy...)

now, we're gonna act like folders dont exist! probably forever! i'll implement it "one day"! ok but paths and everything else might be important

is 1GB = 1024 MB or 1000 MB ???

wait knowing how many paths is actually kinda useless, as its always the number of sprites or its how many seperate "straight or bezier" sections there are, which isn't that useful. i think it'll be better as number of apperances

ok, projects tab is almost done, just a bit left! ("time spent" and "project name")

almost there, just "time spent" and some testing! but first, a quick save!
