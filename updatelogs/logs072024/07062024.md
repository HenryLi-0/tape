# 7/6/2024 - 29th Update!

hello everyone, its 8:20 AM while im writing this. yes, i got up at 7:30 AM for some reason and decided "let's go coding!"! anyways, coding time. bug fixing time! so, even when the path line disappears, there are still somehow 4 connections to the 5 points that still exist, which is weird.

i see what's going on, the last connection of "None" is being brought around!

```
[0.9999999999999993, 10.231501777524002, 'S', 5.000000000000003, 15.021459227467815, 'S', 30.000000000000004, 54.199745804859184, None, 43.49337557579251, 15.021459227467815, 'S', 90.7494543101063, 26.062369909189712, 'S']
```

now, that was a major oversight from me, but that doesn mean its thinking correctly! now we just need to check for things like this happening. we should probably also store the numbers rounded. number check works! (rounding values and connections) it appears that swapping out the last connection for `None` is a speedy way to annoy the user (as connections default to "L", and everytime you move a point to the end, it because linear), so we should probably just make it keep storing it (and fix things that may break from this)

```
[25.0, 12.331, 'S', 60.479, 81.129, 'L', 78.913, 34.154, 'S', 122.992, 54.406, 'S', 133.665, 31.33, 'S']
```

nothing seems to be breaking just yet! currently trying to get coordinates to not crash when switching, but here's the focus for today:
- get connections editor going (like connections between the lines, linear or smooth/bezier)
- create special case for coordinate path editor

you see, aiming to create a pre-release by sunday (tommorow) was definetely a bit ambitious. after finally fixing that crash when switching to mode 1 (coordinates), its time to add some editor for connections

a little silly testing, we can get ~7 FPS even with ~775000 states! thats around 7+ hours! (note: your video will also probably take an hour to render if you do this, but thats still a rough guess. no, i don't want to test that.)

ok, its way later now, but CONNECTIONS ARE EDITABLE NOW!!! WOOO (basically, you have to click and hold and press the keybind for it, which is currently set to Q for linear and W for smooth! its working now!!!)
