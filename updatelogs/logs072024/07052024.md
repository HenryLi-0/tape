# 7/5/2024 - 28th Update!

ok, its currently 1 AM and im motivated (however, i may be more productive the more sleep deprived i am...) anyways, heres a to do list:

- fix that weird bug with the point that appears and is doing nothing
- get connections editor going (like connections between the lines, linear or smooth/bezier)
- create special case for coordinate path editor
- apperance importing (this can wait for next release)
- multiple sprites!!!
- sprite ordering (this can wait for next release)
- timeline (for time things, simple version for now, but more features and details for next release)
- open/save projects (can wait for nezt release)
- exporting projects to video (very silly, but it can wait for next release)

why wait for next release? well, i only have roughly 3 hours of work time (i think?) for this release before any additional hours that i work on it fall into some weird misunderstanding of rules. basically, i need to create a MVP (miminal viable product) for this early test release, so we can continue working on more detailed stuff while making my hours still count (at least, thats how i interpreted the rules?)

anywayd, assuming im motivated when i wake up, exciting things to work on! see you in the morning!
