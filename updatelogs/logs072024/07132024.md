# 7/13/2024 - 35th Update!

i think i broke the streak then (19 days if i dont excuse the competition day, 27 if i do, thats pretty cool!) anyways, back on topic, we have a project to finish!

new plan, of course it can (and likely will) change:
- 7/13/2024 - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - save projects
- 7/15/2024 - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/16/2024 - exporting projects to video

im expecting the actual release to take one more week, but its getting there... at the same time, im planning on starting my next major coding project! also, i have robotics work now, so i need to plan for that as well... (wow my summer just got two times busy...)

ok, its morning time, 10:30 AM here in rainy New York (quite pleasant looking) and in our programming i have programming now (get it? like tv station programming? sorry.)

unfortunately, for exporting projects to videos, my brain couldn't think of anything, even with 2AM energy. however, it did think of this joke:

```
What type of glass is easily angered?
Tempered Glass!
```

there is now a trash can button but clicking it strangely selects sprites in the background? idk why this is happening, but ok. 

"how many parts of the ui will be interacted through scrolling?"

"yes."

just did some apperance panel work! its still a bit broken though

ok, now for the little number thingies, wow, its readable!

idk how to make importing apperances, maybe by path? drag and drop would be cool, but idk if thats possible (research time!)

side note: chatgpt seems to have memories that save across chats, and uh, this summarizes me well

![it knows](</updatelogs/images/072024/07132024 - 3.png>)

the way i structured this code is not smart at all. yes, it makes sense, but it also doesnt...

i drew an import icon and its not too shabby if i do say so myself! if anyone wants me to draw an icon or anything, im open for commisions (joke, i have no idea how to set that up)

copying and pasting code can lead to silly mistakes

woo!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/072024/07132024 - 4.png>)

and importing images work! there's no deleting or scrolling, and the rendering is a bit off right now, but we're getting there!

![what the](</updatelogs/images/072024/07132024 - 5.png>)



wow, 5 images, is that a new record? anyways, its 12:40 AM, and im on the last disc of the last season of this 2013 sci-fi alien tv show thingy, and its certainly something! (can't wait to finish the other tv show from 2010, still two more seasons to watch for that one!) also, that's a download button isn't it. *sigh*. anyways, good night, i hope to be able to wake up earlier than today to code, and i hope to not "oops fell asleep" for like an hour randomly tommorow. good night!
