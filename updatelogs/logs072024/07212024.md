# 7/21/2024 - 43rd Update!

ok, starting things off with making the timeline look better! its currently not looking good enough!

a bit overdone...

![very cool looking](</updatelogs/images/072024/07212024 - 1.png>)

(the color lights up when you select it!!!) also no, you cant change the color (yet). the bars now change sizes! (less sprites = taller bars, more sprites = shorter bars)

ok, moved a couple ui things around in the editors tab, should look better for longer sprite names. "new sprite #" has been changed to "sprite #", and the first sprite "test" in now "sprite"

ok, more final clean up things time! the text on the animation screen has to move! the options section of the screen looks like it wants to have some extra info shoved in that area...

oh wait, docs real quick...

ok, moved stuff to the little options info display box, also changed the save icon a bit, and i think thats it? oh wait, time to code time spent on project! ok, now that's coded. now, we're gonna act like folders don't exist (well... they dont, which is why we're gonna act like they don't exist :D).

ok, a bit more bug hunting? (a while later) can't find any bugs just yet, gonna work on docs! ok, that was a lot of docs work!

wow, the new source control thing looks kind of pretty

![wow](</updatelogs/images/072024/07212024 - 2.png>)

anyways, merged main into releases and removed stuff, releases should be good to go! now, just an epic video needs to be made... (it will take forever.)

ok, just updated version from v0.1.0 to v1.0.0, `README.md` got an update, and i keep accidentally pressing that star button on GitHub (oops...)

- 7/21/2024 - DONE (except the video, of course) - hopefully release?

now, whats else is there to do? im not really sure! of course, there will be a lot of bugs, but im not really sure what else i would add (leave suggestions!). i am feeling a little mixed about leaving this project alone for a while (we are on a 9 day streak, including today), but i'll be working on a seperate project that's not too different from Tape! of course, this other one has a "real" incentive that's just as silly as the incentive behind this!

i'll probably be visiting Tape every now and again to play around with it ~~or to fix the tons of bugs currently hiding around in here~~, and maybe add a feature in here or there. ~~i might one day come back to fix the questionably cursed code structure~~

(this isnt a goodbye just yet!) (now, watch me never show up again...) also, pretty impressive, i "finished" it (well, nothings ever perfect/finished...) a bit before the end of july! (i didnt expect that to happen!)

i'll be working on https://github.com/HenryLi-0/protoplop now! (double check that URL, i may change the repositories name) (i guess the coding grind never stops!...)

now, for possibly the last time in this repository for a while, good night!
