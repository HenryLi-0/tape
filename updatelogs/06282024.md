# 6/28/2024 - 21th Update!

ok, so its actually 6/27/2024 at 2 am right now, and im like really happy. im now inspired (thanks!). good night, see you tommorow!

ok, thanks a lot for that update, me from this early early morning. as i realize that my free coding days are numbered (ive been forced to be tutored and to tutor, how silly), i think i should plan out what to do today:

tasks to (hopefully) finish by today:
- editable text box (visual object)
- implement it in multiple places (multiple text boxes should be able to exist at once)
- hopefully make it look good (a little border around the text that expands as you type looks good...)
- add some debugging features/stats (how many placeOver() are being run per tick, should be easy to add)
- IMAGE ROTATION (i completely forgot about this one)
- ive been wanting to add a .gitignore but ive been forgetting to do it (i'll probably forget to do this again)

ok, ive realized i need to go to google calander and do a bit of planning... (the goal is to finish by the end of july, mid-august at latest (hopefully (take this all with a grain of salt, as ive commited to mining a 128x128 hole in minecraft to bedrock (1.18+ generation) with a pickaxe, and i dont work on it for months at a time. in fact, i think we're on y level 40-55 ish? (its been so long i kind of forgot (how many parenthesis deep are we? (well, point is, this is just a tentative goal)))))) (wow, we're out of those parenthesis layers) cue the coding music!

progress updates:

ok, so text box is really broken right now, you can only edit it when you are clicking the textbox, and it can disappear occasionally... also, turns out the key is Return, not Enter (but its called Enter on my keyboard...?)

yippee it works! 

ok, a couple things im gonna quickly add (first two tasks are done!!!)
- make some colored box array generator, preferably one that can generate boxes with outlines
- some form of "dummy" visual object that just sits there

`fonts.py` has been renamed to `fancy.py`! Ok, now we have both the colored box and the outline box generators, and they appear to work!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/06282024 - 1.png>)

the dummy visual object is there and appears to work correctly as expected! update: text box borders work now! just a little bug that whenever the text box is emptied and then typed into, the text is strangely clipped (task 3 done!) for task 4, i think this wont be neccesary now that i think about it, since "pixels changed" would be a better metric, but that'll be kind of hard to do witht his code structure...

task 5: image rotation! so, i do a little research, and i discovered the essence of python: modules did half the work for you. turns out, after a bit of docs searching (and chatgpt questions), PIL already has things related to image rotation, so it'll hopefully not be as much of a pain! ok, so it's been done!

ok, that was quite a pain to fix, but it seems to spin properly now! first, the image was clipping in the shape of the "straight up" version, so it was losing some of the image when rotated. after setting `expand=True`, it renders properly, but it seems like it has funny gravity and is sticking to the left wall (reminds me a bit of some game). now, after fixing the math, 

```
aSillyCat = rotateDeg(PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE_3_ARRAY, (self.ticks*5)%360)
placeOver(img, aSillyCat, (150+round((128-aSillyCat.shape[1])/2),150+round((128-aSillyCat.shape[0])/2)))
```

it spins around it's center!!! also, it works with rectangles!!! (x and y appear to always be swapped in the numpy arrays, which makes it a bit annoying, but it worked first attempt at rectangles!!!)

wow, already done with all the tasks! time to write a bit more

- update `pathing.py` to include rotation values (spitting out (x,y,dir) instead of just (x,y))

it appears that a little tweaking has fixed the short character only rendering issue! also, it seems that rotations work like this:
- 0 : up
- 90 : left
- 180 : down
- 270 : right
- 360 : up
since i can't name things, this will be called "hehe haha funny rotation". actually "0 up CCW" is better.

ok, coords and rotation path merging works! it looks pretty compact (yes, please make your redstone contraptions as compact as possible. i, in fact, have spent 3+ hours designing a compact timer to fit in the frame of my redstone door...)! anyways, the way the merging will work, is that it will return a list with the length of the larger list and will just repeat the last "limited" list element for the longer list. here's what i mean:

```
from subsystems.pathing import mergeCoordRotationPath
coords = [(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)]
rots = [90,91,92]

print(mergeCoordRotationPath(coords, rots))
[(0, 0, 90), (1, 1, 91), (2, 2, 92), (3, 3, 92), (4, 4, 92)]
```

anyways, check out how compact it is, `tape/subsystems/pathing.py`, `mergeCoordRotationPath()`, currently around line 111!

here's some math i did on paper (no way) (also, apologies for the weird angle)

![whats paper?](</updatelogs/images/06282024 - 2.png>)

i know, crazy math. anyways, it seems to work with the 0 up CCW rotation system! after i shower, assuming my right leg does not disable itself, i'll work on making a path!
