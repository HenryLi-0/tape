# 8/18/2024 - 47th Update!

ok, this should (ideally) be the last day on optimizations? there isnt too much to change (other than maybe limiting updates to sections to "not every tick"? (for example, sprites should not update unless the number os sprites has changed or when the sprite selection has changed, or the offset has changed))

anyways, the optimizations did (certainly) break the path showing up, so probably should fix that now... ok, finally found the bit of code that does the screen path stuff! ok, the code is in a bit of a strange position. currently, the old path stuff uses the old code, where the entire screen was not in regions, and calculates it like that. i guess i can solve the issue of "calculating huge paths for every region is unnecessary" by adding a caclulation function?

ok, it might work, but we cant tell until we start scheduling the regions! part of me wants to be lazy and schedule all regions, but i also only want to update the regions that are involved with it, but it might be easier (and maybe faster) to just schedule all instead of calculating each point's region area (which will probably take forever for huge paths). basically, im trying to say i should probably schedule all the regions

huh, nothings appearing?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08182024 - 1.png>)

somethings quite wrong...

ok, i just realized, this was a bad idea. a smart idea would have been to calculate this all on a screen, then make each region grab a region from this screen and overlay that on top! ok, this change has been made and it works now! great! just kidding, i just realized that this undoes the optimization because it makes a copy of the entire screen array when processing (unnecesary), oops

should be fixed? ok, just realized that the timeline does not need to be grabbing and calculating the sizes of each time bar (aka, fancy timeline) every single tick, and same with the sprites tab! (ok, quick commit incase anything breaks...)

ok, back to working on optimizing the timeline, by the way, its raining here in NYC, and its very calming, just turned off the lights in my room and pulled up the curtains, very cool! now, if only it was cooler and not as humid...

ok, fancy timeline is only updating when needed! now, sprite stuff... actually, im currently reconsidering the neccesity of this, since it doesnt appear very neccesary? it shouldnt take too much power, let me test something...

WHAT

![WHAT](</updatelogs/images/082024/08182024 - 2.png>)

THATS INSANE!!! ok, so basically, what i did was not update the region unless needed, and we are going WICKED FAST! realistically, when calm, the thing is only updating the options region, since the timeline is currently not being processed, and the animation regions aren't being processed (nothings changing anyways), and the editor visuals section isn't updating (currently only updating when interacting or changed property)! ok, a couple things have been fixed, and the same idea has been applied to editor visuals and settings! ok, concept has been applied to the sprites region, and we're going fast! (when we're not doing anything of course, FPS goes down when processing stuff)

ok, we also have the new setting, `DEBUG_BACKGROUND` to make changing the background between "flickering green and red" and "normal"! i have noticed an issue, it seems like we need to move all keybinds to the keybinds area (i suspect that we have the property keybinds detection in the process function instead of in tick?) anyways, quick push!
