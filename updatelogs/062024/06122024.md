# 6/12/2024 - 7th Update!

Ok, today was team dinner day so I came home quite late (it's currently 10PM when I'm starting this coding, I really should be doing homework...) The speeches were a mix of happiness and sadness, but I'm kind of sad right now...

Anyways, while I cope with this, I'm going to do something HOPEFULLY simple today, which is just straight line paths, no fancy curves or anything. 

Ok, it's 2AM on 6/13/2024, I think it's good! I'm going to sleep now. However, there is a giant insect in my room somewhere, so I think I'll be sleeping in the living room.

One last thing, speed test! Here's the results: `1000 tests | avg: 0.007570874214172363 seconds` It makes sense that it is faster than the bezier curve version, since it doesn't really require as much processing power.
