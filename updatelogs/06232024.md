# 6/23/2024 - 16th Update!

wow, i've been working on this for 16 days?

so, yesterday was a robotics competition, had to wake up at 3 AM, ate dinner at 11 PM, and went to sleep at 1 AM (it's like getting up at 6 AM and going to bed at 4 AM). Now that I'm less sleep deprived, it's programming time!

Today started off with a couple FPS tests, but here's the important stuffs: `visuals.py` is a thing now and `render.py` has plans for a dangerous version of `placeOver()` that just adds the matrices (it will not care if something is already there, which is why it is dangerous). `visuals.py` is planned has a `VisualManager()`, which everything that is frequently updated should be wrapped in. `VisualManager()` should save the last couple of input -> outputs, so that if the same input is repeatingly called, it doesn't waste resources recreating it. It just needs a worker (a thing that will return something given an input when `worker.get()` is run)!

Anyways, I guess the next step is to actually write the dangerous version of `placeOver()` and to code a couple workers!
