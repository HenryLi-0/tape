# 7/5/2024 - 28th Update!

ok, its currently 1 AM and im motivated (however, i may be more productive the more sleep deprived i am...) anyways, heres a to do list:

- fix that weird bug with the point that appears and is doing nothing
- get connections editor going (like connections between the lines, linear or smooth/bezier)
- create special case for coordinate path editor
- apperance importing (this can wait for next release)
- multiple sprites!!!
- sprite ordering (this can wait for next release)
- timeline (for time things, simple version for now, but more features and details for next release)
- open/save projects (can wait for nezt release)
- exporting projects to video (very silly, but it can wait for next release)

why wait for next release? well, i only have roughly 3 hours of work time (i think?) for this release before any additional hours that i work on it fall into some weird misunderstanding of rules. basically, i need to create a MVP (miminal viable product) for this early test release, so we can continue working on more detailed stuff while making my hours still count (at least, thats how i interpreted the rules?)

anywayd, assuming im motivated when i wake up, exciting things to work on! see you in the morning!

i keep accidentlaly falling asleep for an hour and waking up. good afternoon! just woke up after an unexpected nap, and fixed a weird bug where points would slowly disappear and lead to a crash after resorting the order of points by time multiple times. it also appears that in my attempts to fix this by adding `-1` everywhere, i accidentally created the weird point? oh i just realized that that was very silly. range(10) goes from 0 to 9, not 0 to 10. oh. oops.

connections editor time, we don't have much time... visual object made, finishing logic and preparing for testing... yeah thats a lot of debugging.

ok, so its been a while and it seems that its rendering properly!!!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/072024/07052024 - 1.png>)

also something great, just this evening, i recieved some Hack Club stickers in the mail!!! thanks! (they're cool!) now, you can't edit the connection just yet, but its planned! (as in, linear/smooth)

ok, i was playing around with moving points, and it appears that if they are super far away from each other, points just forget that they have connections. now, that's a problem, as we, err, store our points in a list with dementia... ok, a quick update later, i think i found the issue and fixed it, trying to replicate situation... it's still broken, it appears that the connectors just self destruct!

ok, they're still disappearing... strange. unfortunately, i am not supposed to be up at 12:30 AM coding with the lights on, as I'm supposed to have a proper sleep schedule (1 AM to 8 AM works though...). so, unfortunately, unfinished bug fixing. ive tried the approach of reloading all the points every couple ticks, but that just made it feel like the mouse kept dropping the point (wait that shouldn't happen...)

anyways, i'll look into it tommorow morning (phew, finally finished that essay...), good night!
