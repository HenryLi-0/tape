# 7/17/2024 - 39th Update!

- 7/17/2024 - exporting projects to video
- 7/18/2024 - polish up and UI stuff
- 7/19/2024 - hopefully release?

uhhh i dont want to do video exporting... but i have to. ok, im gonna distract myself by drawing the button's icon! im gonna quickly add those in...

wow, my computer's handling a video conference, vscode, two browsers (37 tabs total) and a music app at the same time... that's insane!

ok, so i found out that openCV does, in fact, export to .avi, which supports alpha channel transparency, and can open here on windows! that's great! ok, playing around with it, and it seems that i need to write some code to make all the images the same size...

ok, turns out ive been scammed and it doesn't support aplha channel transparency? whats happening??? ok so ive been scammed and opencv doesnt export with alpha channel transparency??? what is my research (chatgpt) saying? ok seems like nothing's working, that's great! (ok im spending way too long, but i don't think we can export with transparency?)

ok im gonna push, but its not working yet (we need to detect the last point because the video needs to know when to end) also, found a strange path bug (unexpected)

its quite something, the experience of debugging and having a song about fish stuck in your head

hey, got it working! only took 13 attempts! but we're exporting in .mp4 now! 

ok, second attempt, gif is exporting! however, its strangely slow...

yes yes yes! exporting to gif is done! (5 attempts!) ok, still need to fix that path bug, but its looking good!

- 7/17/2024 - DONE - exporting projects to video
- 7/18/2024 - polish up and UI stuff
- 7/19/2024 - hopefully release?

looks like we're on track? hopefully it stays that way...

ok, that path bug seems to be fixed! (inappropriate rounding was the issue) now, there is something strange about clicking that i should probably fix, which is that clicking nothing, then moving your mouse onto something grabs it, which shouldn't be the case for important buttons? 

ok, small change but pretty important, testing for interactable things under the mouse now only happens if it is a rising edge. this should make UI interacting more straightforward/expected?

ok, i think that's it for today, good night!
