# 6/4/2024 - Update #1

First update! The repository was made a couple days ago, but I didn't really have anytime to work on it... should probably get started...

Anyways, I did a little math this morning and here's the results:

![funny math](</updatelogs/images/062024/06042024 - 1.png>)

Yes, I did that in Google Slides. Now, I'm not sure if this is actually Bezier curves, but I think it is, but you get the point. Lets do a little more math together.

Point 1: $(x_{1},y_{1})$

Point 3: $(x_{3},y_{3})$

Line between P1 and P3: $f\left(x\right)=\frac{y_{3}-y_{1}}{x_{3}-x_{1}}\left(x-x_{1}\right)+y_{1}$

Point 2: $(x_{2},y_{2})$

Midpoint of 1 and 3: $\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2},\frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}\right)$

Point A (Point 2 - To Midpoint Vector (idk what to call it)): $\left(2x_{2}-\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2},2y_{2}-\frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}\right)$

Ok, so we got our three points for the curve, 

Point 1: $(x_{1},y_{1})$

Point 3: $(x_{3},y_{3})$

Point A (Point 2 - To Midpoint Vector (idk what to call it)): $\left(2x_{2}-\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2},2y_{2}-\frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}\right)$

Now we have to do the funny Bezier curve maths. This may involve parametric equations???

Line between P1 and P A: $g\left(x\right)=\frac{y_{a}-y_{1}}{x_{a}-x_{1}}\left(x-x_{1}\right)+y_{1}$

Line between P3 and P A: $h\left(x\right)=\frac{y_{a}-y_{3}}{x_{a}-x_{3}}\left(x-x_{3}\right)+y_{3}$

So we need to turn distance (in part of) from each line, set one of the 1-%, and equation, then create a line across

$a_{1}\left(x\right)=x_{1}-x\left(x_{1}-x_{a}\right)$

$b_{1}\left(x\right)=y_{1}-x\left(y_{1}-y_{a}\right)$

$a_{2}\left(x\right)=x_{3}-x\left(x_{3}-x_{a}\right)$

$b_{2}\left(x\right)=y_{3}-x\left(y_{3}-y_{a}\right)$

and here, where u is the percentage

$\left(a_{1}\left(u\right),b_{1}\left(u\right)\right)$

$\left(a_{2}\left(1-u\right),b_{2}\left(1-u\right)\right)$

and all together

$c\left(x\right)=\frac{b_{2}\left(1-u\right)-b_{1}\left(u\right)}{a_{2}\left(1-u\right)-a_{1}\left(u\right)}\left(x-a_{1}\left(u\right)\right)+b_{1}\left(u\right)$

and to see the curve

$u=\left[0,0.1,...,1\right]$

turning the last function into one equation, we get this

$c\left(x\right)=\frac{\left(y_{3}-\left(1-u\right)\left(y_{3}-y_{a}\right)\right)-\left(y_{1}-\left(u\right)\left(y_{1}-y_{a}\right)\right)}{\left(x_{3}-\left(1-u\right)\left(x_{3}-x_{a}\right)\right)-\left(x_{1}-\left(u\right)\left(x_{1}-x_{a}\right)\right)}\left(x-\left(x_{1}-\left(u\right)\left(x_{1}-x_{a}\right)\right)\right)+\left(y_{1}-\left(u\right)\left(y_{1}-y_{a}\right)\right)$

and further simplifying we get

$c\left(x\right)=\left(\frac{y_{a}-y_{1}+u\left(y_{3}+y_{1}-2y_{a}\right)}{x_{a}-x_{1}+u\left(x_{3}+x_{1}-2x_{a}\right)}\right)\left(x-x_{1}+\left(u\right)\left(x_{1}-x_{a}\right)\right)+y_{1}-uy_{1}+uy_{a}$

and from trying to remove point A from the equation, we get

$c\left(x\right)=\left(\frac{2y_{2}-\frac{3y_{1}}{2}-\frac{y_{3}}{2}+2uy_{3}+2uy_{1}-4uy_{2}}{2x_{2}-\frac{3x_{1}}{2}-\frac{x_{3}}{2}+2ux_{3}+2ux_{1}-4ux_{2}}\right)\left(x-x_{1}-2ux_{2}+\frac{3ux_{1}}{2}+\frac{ux_{3}}{2}\right)+y_{1}+2uy_{2}-\frac{3uy_{1}}{2}-\frac{uy_{3}}{2}$

which simplifies to

$c\left(x\right)=\left(\frac{4y_{2}-3y_{1}-y_{3}+4u\left(y_{3}+y_{1}-2y_{2}\right)}{4x_{2}-3x_{1}-x_{3}+4u\left(x_{3}+x_{1}-2x_{2}\right)}\right)\left(x-x_{1}+2u\left(-x_{2}+\frac{3x_{1}}{4}+\frac{x_{3}}{4}\right)\right)+y_{1}-2u\left(-y_{2}+\frac{3y_{1}}{4}+\frac{y_{3}}{4}\right)$

(yes, i, in fact, did do most of the math on paper)

now it just then needs to calculate to intersections of the perecent lines and move across...

now, code implementation... ahh
