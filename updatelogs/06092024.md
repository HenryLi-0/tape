# 6/9/2024 - 5th Update!

why are we still doing math...

Ok, so, `pathing.py` rewrite!!! Here's some math I've collected:

$a\left(t\right)=\left(1-t\right)^{2}\left(x_{1},y_{1}\right)+2\left(1-t\right)t\left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)+t^{2}\left(x_{3},y_{3}\right)$

$b\left(t\right)=\left(1-t\right)^{2}\left(x_{3},y_{3}\right)+2\left(1-t\right)t\left(2\cdot\left(x_{3},y_{3}\right)-\left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)\right)+t^{2}\left(x_{6},y_{6}\right)$

$a\left(u\right)$

$b\left(u\right)$

$u=\left[0,0.1,...,1\right]$

Yes, I know this can be a little simplier in Desmos, but whatever. So, there's an example of the maths that we need to implement. It seems that every single "middle point" between two points can be based on the previous and current set of points (except for the first one). In the Desmos example, $\left[\left(x_{1},y_{1}\right),\left(x_{2},y_{2}\right),\left(x_{3},y_{3}\right)\right]$ are in curve 1 and $\left[\left(x_{3},y_{3}\right),\left(x_{6},y_{6}\right)\right]$ are in curve 2. (note that $\left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)$ is the little bezier thingy, not an actual path point). Ok, so my research basically told me the relation between the "little middle point thingy" for quadratic Bezier curves. The part before that is that the previous curve section must end where the next starts, which makes very much sense. So now, we appear to be ready for the next part! Coding this!
