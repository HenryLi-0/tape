# 7/3/2024 - 26th Update!

ok, ive been thinking, and i have a silly idea for the first test animation when everythings done, something that really tests how this thing works (like how well it operates)!

anyways, its morning time and im being forced to leave the house for lunch, so see you all in the afternoon! ok, quick update before i am being forced to go, i made a little formula for the scrolling thing, and it seems to be moving nicely! there's no limit to how far you can zoom out, so you can zoom out to points in time thousands of years in the future. i think that, in hopes that no user accidentally starts a thousand year long render, we need a zoom out limit!

ok, theres a zoom limit and now, its working nicely! the only issue is that after some offset, the lines dont render anymore, and i think i know how to fix it...

```
((i*(10**math.floor(math.log(self.graphScale+0.000001,10)+1)))-self.graphOffset)*(1/(self.graphScale+0.000001))*25 = 0
(i*(10**math.floor(math.log(self.graphScale+0.000001,10)+1)))-self.graphOffset = 0
i = self.graphOffset/(10**math.floor(math.log(self.graphScale+0.000001,10)+1))
```

wow, we found out how to calculate i for when 0, it seems to be working correctly! the image also appears to be showing up on the correct spot! also, after helping lift giant rice bag upstairs (by myself...), i had a bad idea. ~~what if we had another version of tape with 3D paths? (NO WE'RE NOT DOING THIS RIGHT NOW)~~ anyways, back to coding! oh look, that random energetic spanish song ~~that my spanish 2 going to 3 brain cant understand, i really shouldnt be going to spanish 3...~~ is playing (its a good song!)!

ok, it appears that the graph points are appearing and offset properly! gonna quickly commit...
