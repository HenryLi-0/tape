# 8/19/2024 - 48th Update!

ok, maybe today will be the last day! anyways, we have bugs to fix, and cursed icons to fix! ok, most things are icons now, gotta rename them properly now!

![wow](</updatelogs/images/082024/08192024 - 1.png>)

broke a couple things, but it should now be fixed! ok, icons are done! bug fixing time! hmm, still have no clue how to fix the point connections bug... (not related to that bug, but) also, got rid of the keybind cooldowns for the timeline and graphs! ok, so idk, but i dont think my fixes work. it does seem, however, that pressing left control updates it correctly??? im gonna commit real quick

i know ive encountered this before and have fixed it, so im gonna try looking in very old commits... ah! looks like writing update logs helps a lot! seems like it was fixed on 7/5/2024 or 7/6/2024... ok, i dont think it helps too much, but it has given me an idea! wait i think i found something, it seems like its because the data is out of order? ok, seems to be working, but it broke something else... ok, its working now!

so the problem was is that it appears that, upon regen, the data doesn't sort itself out? so basically, the data went from, example, points at seconds: [0, 7, 3], which would make the compact data reader confused and return a connection from 0 to 7 and ??? (it was either an empty list or had one point). so, its fixed by sorting the data upon regen! (and also setting the compact data to the sorted version!). ok, then, i also fixed some updating issues when switching tabs, (used to appear to lag behind but is actually just the section not knowing it needed to be updated)

ok, time to test if everythings working! ok, something with smooth paths are broken... ok, the pathing bug should be fixed? now, there is also an issue with the orbs randomly rendering and randomly not... ok, it seems to be working properly (it seems that finding the extent is working?) ok, from settings, special outline colors have been removed! (export buttons now have normal outlines)

ok ok, so i just edited some of the opening project code, and we have a bit more backwards compatibility! of course, probably no one else ever made a project while the saving code was still in the middle of developing its first version (other than me...), so this shouldn't really affect too many people, except maybe the ones who corrupted some parts of their save file? (well, if its actually corrupted, dont get your hopes too high)

ah, feels good, coding late at night with my room lit up by my lamp and listening to music in the background... (now, if only it was colder). did you know i got bit by a mosquito twice after going outside today? (why is it only me that gets bitten, always first and always the most?) anyways, time for v1.1???

ok, just had a nightmare of merge conflicts, decided to do silly rebasing, messed the whole thing up, got saved by git's time travelling features, allowing me to rewrite history and stop that from happening (yes, i do think of git as time travelling.) but yeah, we should be in main now and successfully merged! and with rebased commits! everything seems faster, seems to be working!
