# 6/29/2024 - 22nd Update!

ok ok, its currently 12 AM, and i just finished disc 3 of season 3. what's also important is that i thought of how to approach this issue while brushing my teeth. all "animated images", not neccesarily visual objects, but the sprites that move across the screen will have to have a set of "properties" at all times. here's a quick draft of a couple properties:

- position+orientation (x,y,dir)
- effects (transparency, color shift, brightness, etc.)

so we know that it must have some form of this information every animation frame, as like some form of "state". now, this "state" is determined by deafults, and the editor aspect of it, where that modifies the properties. for example, when processing the animation, there can be a path element in the editor from `0 seconds to 2 seconds`, which modifies position and maybe orientation during that time. maybe theres also a transparency effect from `1 second to 3 seconds`, which modifies the transparency during that time frame. the only problem i can currently see with this is multiple events conflicting with each other, which might just show up as red in the editor and prioritize the first one.

now, when the user requests to see a frame of the video, the code should look through the "property modifiers", or, basically, the "editor elements", and basically process what state of properties the sprite should be in at that frame. another benefit of this approach (that, well, now that i think about it, works with other approaches too), is that the elements in the editor don't need to be in order. ok, im going to sleep now, can't wait to get coding tommorow morning! (well, today morning)

so, to simplify this, we have SPRITES that are images that have ELEMENTS (editable in the editor), which modify the STATE/PROPERTIES of the SPRITE in accordance to TIME. now, the images that move around hte screen will not be interactable, just the editor can edit them. also, quickly, before we do this stuff, we should clean up the animation screen. ok, the animation portion is empty now, and the helpful text stuff is now temporarily moved into the timeline portion (it's only there temporarily!)

ok, so the current UI plan is to have the editor have movable rectangular elements for the paths and follow things, but i am also considering using a graph based UI, where one axis is a property and the other is time. the benefit of this is that it would be easier to code the properties, as it is a literal graph, but the other version just requires searching through ELEMENTS. it would be more clear to the user what's going on, but it may be tricky/unclear for paths. afater sitting and thinking about it, i think we should stick with the original plan, but keep this graph UI in consideration later. wait, i just realized another benefit of the graph approach, the ability to create advanced "paths" for effects, for example, a non-linear size change. 

also, the ELEMENTS will show up in the VISUALS tab! (just to clarify!)

here's more effects i think would be rather useful:
- size
- color shift
- transparency
- brightness
- pixelation

here's the redesign of the editor tab in visual mode!

![oo look, a graph!](</updatelogs/images/06292024 - 1.png>)

basically, you can click on lines and set them to straight or curved and edit the curve, (of course with max 1 or 100%). now, for paths, it will be a similar editor, but the graph will display velocity/change in position, and the points, when clicked, will show up on the animation as interractable visual orbs. (also, the little bar on the right shows what it is about, transparency is shown.) to also improve productivity, i think it would be smart to assign each one a number, of course, intuitive to me and no one else (just kidding, this will likely be a changable setting)

`sprite.py` is a thing now, you can see the sprite data storage there! here are planned keybinds:
- 1 : path (coords)
- 2 : path (degrees)
- 3 : size
- 4 : color
- 5 : transparency
- 6 : brightness
- 7 : pixelation

ok, when im back, i'll try to make the visual template (you know, the image in the files) for the outlines, and adding the simple UI parts of the section!

unfortunately, instead of planning like he expected, i just fell asleep for the past hour. oops. anyways, template time! now, while my music streaming service is spamming ads at me, i need to think of some important logic. so STEPS are basically the FPS, so if there are more seconds, ex. a smooth change across 3 seconds, will have more STEPS into the function compared to less seconds, ex. a smooth change across 1 second. also, the UI template is rendering properly and showing up correctly in the tab!

after getting into a lot of dead ends, i finally found a formula i think i like for this $f\left(x\right)=a+\left(b-a\right)\log_{s}\left(x+1\right)$

ok, `smoothChangeAt()` and `straightChangesAt()` have been added to `pathing.py`!

after eating dinner, and moving around my house like a crazy swerve drive (i am silly), i thought of a pretty good way for the thing to quickly discover what state something is currently in from the list. we all know that everything in there is TIME based, so we can have it stored in seconds upon every list, so we can quickly iterate through, and find out what the current state is by finding what the time is in between, say, 11.55 seconds is between a certain state at 10 seconds and another state at 12 seconds. while this may be intuitive, it did give me an idea of how to strucutre the sprite to make sense. so, each time state for each property, can be stored like this:
```
[
    1, [state], connection to next,
    2, [state], connection to next,
    5, [state], connection to next,
    10, [state], None
]
```
alternatively, we can have more complex styles, but i think we'll keep this nice and simple for now. when we need to call something, say, the state at 3 seconds, we find states at 2 and 5 seconds, and look at the connection and calculate the state between the timed states. this approach is good for the simple 1 to 1 connections, but gets weird when we talk about longer paths, say the beizer one. the bezier paths don't neccesarily stop and go at every connection, it is a chain of coordinates, so it would need logic to search for the bezier path. however, let's focus on the simplier properties first. also, bezier coordinate paths will be created using the "smooth" button in the UI (a special "bezier" button isnt too neccesary?). im gonna shower, then continue coding! 

ok, coding this is actually a little tricky (no, just the part of making it look good). also in the example, `[state]` can also be in string format, not neccesarily just a list (for most effect properties, they will just be single numbers, so it isn't smart to store it as a list)

ok, a little bit of testing through this a more complicated compact list, and it appears to work!

![very cool](</updatelogs/images/06292024 - 2.png>)

now, it should be a bit easy to reuse parts of the code for the sequence generator from compact list!

ok, both `iterateThoughSingle()` and `findStateThroughSingle()` seem to be working! now, before i get a bunch of angry complaints saying "you've been on your computer for the whole day!1!11!1", im gonna quickly finish this log. also, turns out, my summer becomes very busy starting next monday, so that's why i am really rushing to finish this before all that work starts! (it will certainly slow things down) the next thing that needs to be done is connecting this stuff to the `generateSequence()` and `getStateAt()` parts of the `Sprite` object!
