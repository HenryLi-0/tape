# 7/21/2024 - 43rd Update!

ok, starting things off with making the timeline look better! its currently not looking good enough!

a bit overdone...

![very cool looking](</updatelogs/images/072024/07212024 - 1.png>)

(the color lights up when you select it!!!) also no, you cant change the color (yet). the bars now change sizes! (less sprites = taller bars, more sprites = shorter bars)

ok, moved a couple ui things around in the editors tab, should look better for longer sprite names. "new sprite #" has been changed to "sprite #", and the first sprite "test" in now "sprite"

ok, more final clean up things time! the text on the animation screen has to move! the options section of the screen looks like it wants to have some extra info shoved in that area...

oh wait, docs real quick...
