# 6/30/2024 - 23rd Update!

so, i did forget to pull...

ok, so i think i implemented `iterateThoughSingle()` and `findStateThroughSingle()` in sprite logic for the single 1-1 conenctions, but i'm gonna test it later, once everything is working! now, coordinate paths need to work (just to reiterate, its a bit harder than the simple 1-1 connections that the compact storage will use, as it can connect through multiple coordinates/states for the bezier paths)

ive been forced to go outside

anyways, now that im back home, its time to program `iterateThroughPath()` and `findStateThroughPath()`! debugging this one will be a pain!

![well that was painful](</updatelogs/images/06302024 - 2.png>)

well, it seems to work now! `iterateThroughPath()` seems good, now its `findStateThroughPath()` time and time to implement these functions/methoeds into the sprite object! now, while planning on finishing that, i realized that whenever bezier paths were used that required some sense of time, `bezierPathCoords()` doesn't really care. it only cares about the steps between each, but that's constant the entire time. so, introducing a new function/methoed, `timelyBezierPathCoords()`!

ok, now that that's implemented properly, gonna add a couple docs and acutally get to what i was planning (`timelyBezierPathCoords()` took much longer than expected!)

![yay](</updatelogs/images/06302024 - 3.png>)

ok, docs added, back on track! (i'm gonna quickly push with an incomplete `findStateThroughPath()` as i think my brain is a little fried now)

ok, im back from dinner, im not sure if its worth it, but im adding another beizer path function/methoed for only generatating specific sections (maybe someone will make a 500 point bezier path and start lagging a whole lot). introducting the third beizer function/methoed to join the group, `selectiveBezierPathCoords()`! of course, you'll be tested a whole lot. as someone (probably) once said, "optimization is very very good". if no one said that before, i am fine if you use that quote.

after around half an hour of being confused why the identical functions/methoeds, copy pasted, character for character, were producing different results, i found out we had a math.random() (just kidding, that was NOT be the bezier methoed).so the actual problem was that the code was editing the original list, messing everything up. this is not supposed to happen. i am very glad that i caught this from frustration before implementing this everywhere! hopefully i remember to fix this.

anyways, `selectiveBezierPathCoords()` is working! 

(now, here's a little editing magic, but another half an hour has passed...) i have finally finished making `findStateThroughPath()` work (at least it appears?)!

![seems to work for inconsistent timing compact paths](</updatelogs/images/06302024 - 5.png>)

havent tested fully weirder compact paths that aren't fully smooth bezier paths... also, 5 images in today's log is crazy... update: turns out that mixed linear and smooth coordinate paths are broken. 

nvm its working
