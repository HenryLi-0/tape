# 7/2/2024 - 25th Update!

ok, got rotation working, and it seems pretty good! to account for the image not being positioned in the middle, the interface still has to calculate the offsets from the rotation (maybe we should set `center = True` for all sprite image rendering that uses `placeOver()` to center all of them?). after thinking about it, its probably more intuitive to the user is all the sprites were centered, so that's gonna be added! 

its now a bit later in the day, and i just woke up at unexpectedly sleeping for an hour. strangely, it is roughlt te same amount of time i usually sleep when waiting for the bus to get from school to home, wihch is a little strange. anyways, i shoved in a new path, and it seems following it good! after watching it a couple times, i think that we should modifyt the image's rotation last. heres this difference as a gif:

as we can see, it appears that place rotation first allows the "pixelation" (i will change this term to blur), can destroy the rotational information by making the image basically a large blured single pixel, which kind of defeats the purpose of the rotation. therefore, i think that the image should be rotated last to allow the rotation (since its pretty important?) to stay. we also see a bit of clipping with placing rotation first? so its probably best to move it to the bottom.

also, did you know, during lunch i ate a bit of sand and now i feel a little weird and sleepy, so im gonna hope that its just from the random sleep and that im not gonna have to do the next coding session in a hospital's emergency room :D

ok, new UI plan, not very big of a change, but i should probably still update this about it!

ok, wrote a little image resizer with a given limited size (width x height) (square)! getting data from the sprite seems to be working, gonna quickly save!

selected keybinds (original one from 6/29/2024, updated with the new stuff):
- 1 : path (coords)
- 2 : path (degrees)
- 3 : apperance
- 4 : size
- 5 : color
- 6 : transparency
- 7 : brightness
- 8 : blur

working on the graph right now! the bars are appearing nicely! gonna quickly commit here...
