# 6/8/2024 - 4th Update!

Ok, after review this, the problem appeared to be that I did a little silly. In pathing, turns out that I just set x to 0 instead of distributing. This mistake makes since, since I should actually distribute the front of the equation to the x and the rest of it, move the rest of it to the $b$ (in $y=mx+b$) and the x part would be the $m$. Basically:

This is the correct equation: 

$\left(\frac{4y_{2}-3y_{1}-y_{3}+4u\left(y_{3}+y_{1}-2y_{2}\right)}{4x_{2}-3x_{1}-x_{3}+4u\left(x_{3}+x_{1}-2x_{2}\right)}\right)x+\left(\frac{4y_{2}-3y_{1}-y_{3}+4u\left(y_{3}+y_{1}-2y_{2}\right)}{4x_{2}-3x_{1}-x_{3}+4u\left(x_{3}+x_{1}-2x_{2}\right)}\right)\left(-x_{1}+2u\left(-x_{2}+\frac{3x_{1}}{4}+\frac{x_{3}}{4}\right)\right)+y_{1}-2u\left(-y_{2}+\frac{3y_{1}}{4}+\frac{y_{3}}{4}\right)$

That front part is the $mx$ and that back part is the $b$. After fixing this, we get a nice little:

Yay! It works now! It also appears that `pathing.py` also provides some reusable code if you want to make some basic Algebra 1 stuff. I don't know, I should probably delete useless stuff, but I will say what I always say: *"It may come helpful in the future..."* (keyword: *may*)

There is also now a `roundf(n,m)` function! It will round n with m digits after the decimal place. This is because storing floats that are way to accurate will not be useful, and will probably just be a waste of space. The accuracy defaults to 3 and can be configured in settings (`PATH_FLOAT_ACCURACY`)! It'll only be rounded at the final output, which is for `path3coords()`! `roundp()` rounds the `(x,y)` components of the point to `PATH_FLOAT_ACCURACY` after the decimal point (using `roundf()`) and returns it!

Anyways, I'll be back later today after I'm done doing this tutoring stuff. Yes, I should be teaching students right now, but my turn to teach already happened so...

One more thing, after setting up a little speed test, from the range of (2500,2500) to (-2500,-2500) and steps set to 60 (for 60 FPS), we get an average of 0.000954 seconds per test (n=1000)! If you're feeling a little silly, and want to go for 1000 steps (1000 FPS), you get an average of 0.0153 seconds (n=1000)! Remember, I am currently supposed to be tutoring and zoom is running in the background. Also, 1000 FPS is not realistic. Ok, we seem to be getting consistently around 0.001 seconds for any test with 60 FPS (large coordinate ranges don't seem to affect this). Very nice!

Ok, I need to go tutor some kids now.

So, what's next? I don't know. I'm just going to quickly reorganize `pathing.py` to be better formatted. Ok, I'm back, I remembered something to do. We only have a 3 point path, we need a 3+ point path. We need like multiple points for it to go to (ahhhhh)

Ok, how do we do this? Well, **AVERAGE** (idk how else). We average connections and combine the points! So, how? I guess we should instead generate paths in 0.5 u. For example, first, in the first section (points 1, 2, 3), the first half (point 1 to 2) as one list and the second half (point 2 to 3) as another list. Then, for the next section (points 2, 3, 4), the first half is (point 2 to 3) and the second half is (point 3 to 4).

At the end, we may end up with something like this, for 5 points

- point 1-2 (a)
- point 2-3 (a), point 2-3 (b)  (these get averaged)
- point 3-4 (b), point 3-4 (c)  (these get averaged)
- point 4-5 (c)

Ok, let's get coding! Wow, how much free time do I get from tutoring? Ok, now that tutoring time is over, time to continue coding!

Ok, so it's now 6 PM, and, after a bit of testing, realized that averaging is NOT the best way to do this. Simulating the movements in Scratch, we get something buggy and not smooth

So, as you can see, this Scratch cat does not move in a perfect circle like fashion. Completely disgusting. So now, after doing some research, it turns out I was making a form of bootleg Bezier curve and the reality is much simplier. *sigh* time to rewrite... (Of course, COMMIT YOUR CODE FIRST)

Ok, I also thought of something else to do: ROTATING! Now, we are going to do a little silly here. How are we going to do this? I think these may be the most important to make:
- Path following (so it moves where it goes)
- Consistent spinning (just spins)
- Some sine wave? (like it's oscilating between two directions in a sine wave behavior)

Oh no, I wonder how we are going to make the editor...
