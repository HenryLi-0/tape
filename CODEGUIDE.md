# Code Guide

Hello! Looks like you're interested in this code! Whether you're a programmer or someone who stumbled across this repository, here's the way this code is stored:

**tape/** 

where everything is

- `main.py` : just initializes everything
- `SETTINGS.py` : contains important constants, and some editable settings
- `checks.py` : checks that important resources exist to prevent random crashes



**tape/subsystems** 

where useful code exists across different files

- finish documentation...
