# 7/7/2024 - 30th Update!

ok turns out i was a bit more eepy then i thought... (i slept until 10 AM, 5 hours later than planned).

ok, over ambitious pre-release day! lets try to finish major stuff by midnight! this reminds me of that time i did my entire engineering report in 8th grade (basically document building something and (although unnecessary but i misread the instructions) run an experiment to test its effectiveness) over the course of a couple hours. i also had to build an entire board for marking period 3, and i finished it all in one night at 3 AM. (you are meant to spent months on it.) anyways, to work!

things to do:
- timeline (for time things, simple version for now, but more features and details for next release)
- create special case for coordinate path editor
- multiple sprites!!!

ok, copied the scrolling code over from graph as the timeline is basically the same thing without any fancy stuff! just fixed a thing where point can render outside of the graph! its a little while later, and i added the timeline time bar thingy! you can click to set it to a position on the timeline! keybinds have been switched, "Z" and "X" to move left and right in the graph (respectively), and "Left" and "Right" to move left and right in the timeline (respectively). of course, these are changable!
