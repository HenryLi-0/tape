# 7/20/2024 - 42nd Update!

good morning its 6:15 AM and it took me 3 attempts to type the time (i dont think i got much sleep yesterday)

ok 7:20 AM and its time to go, changed some random things, textbox is still acting funny...

its 9:30 PM at night and im ignoring messages from my volunteering place (its the weekend, you already take 20+ hours per week! next time youll see me is monday!)

oh know i know why it works, cursed regeneration! anyways, now for changing the UI a little...

ok, reverted and redid some changes, moved things around, and there's sprite name editing! now for some fancy timeline work...

woo! the simple version is working! im gonna polish it up tommorow, as i am likely going to be told to go to sleep very soon. but its looking good!

![wow very cool](</updatelogs/images/072024/07202024 - 1.png>)

also, forgot to mention, we got scammed by some food place and ended up paying around 304% (yes, more than 3x) what they original said (i will investigate this later, im very tired and eepy)

good night!
