# 6/14/2024 - 8th Update!

Ok, a bit of programming was done, but I'll get to the real part that I'm interested in

Ta da! Here's an experimental UI! 

I think something like this looks good, but I need to double check that everything I plan for/want is there. Also, yes, I doodled that. It is a reference to something. If you know, you know. (the song is pretty good) 

Anyways, I should be studying for the upcoming Regents, but I'll probably get bored every once in a while, which is enough time to contribute to the project!

Now, for UI related stuff, I decided to stay away from pygame for this one, since I like tkinter's way of windows. Unfortunately, a lot of it is object based, but I thought of a silly methoed. Let's program the entire thing and compress it into a picture, and the user sees that picture being updated on their screen. That's basically what the new `interface.py` is, just a little test. At first, using a different thread to update the image caused the image to violently flash, which probably would have been very bad if I had epilepsy. However, using the `windows.after()` fixed this problem. With it, it introduces a new setting, `INTERFACE_FPS`! The code then uses the number to calculate the delay between screen updates (in milliseconds).

Anyways, it's now time for me to read an hour's worth of WPILIB docs. See ya!

A little edit a while later at night: **WOW THAT UI LOOKS BEAUTIFUL** However, during dinner time, I realize we need to fit a settings button somewhere (probably the top right, along with maybe some fancy debugging tools?)
