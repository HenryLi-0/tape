# 6/16/2024 - 10th Update!

Ok, so I just visited a higher dimension after drawing blood... (is that what you  call it? idk, basically some blood test or soemthing) (i also couldnt hear a little, but no I'm better!)

So, here's a little update from the car, as both my hands hurt (yes, they had to try both hands, my blood is oddly slow at moving?)

Ideas: 
- Only updating when needed (well, that's kind of obvious)
- We can sacrifice a bit of memory to store partially already-calculated version of the screen that the code believes will be used frequently, so we don't need to recalculate
- Some mix of idea 1 and 2?
- Store a lot of the assets needed as images (maybe numpy arrays? or convert then while booting up?), so we won't need to create them from nothing
- Everything should be an array until the end!!! (So image -> array -> maths and storing and stuff -> array -> image)

Well, that's a little update from the car, hopefully I remember to `git pull` later...

Ok, I'm on the computer now!

Here are a bit more optimizations we can do:
- Sacrifice storage space for converted images (i will likely add some option to clear all saved or delete some saved)
- Use .json for "projects"
- Use UUIDs to identify which images are in each project
- Probably have a temporary file for each session?
- Probably have a loading screen...

Well, just made a loading screen!

Ah, NYC is always beautiful! Anyways, coding time!
