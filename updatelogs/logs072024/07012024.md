# 7/1/2024 - 24th Update!

ok, even though its not spring, `tape/updatelogs/` REALLY needs a clean up! the images folder now is sorted by month, and logs are also sorted by months! (now, we should be good for like two years, hopefully i finish most development by then!) anyways, today's one of the last days before ~~pain~~ tutoring (i am getting tutored) starts and then my entire busy schedule starts, so let's make this count!

while eating breakfast today, i realized that it would be really annoying if the sprite only had one image, so you would have to create a new sprite for every single thing. so, i realized it would be a good idea to have multiple images/appearances that can be changable through time (so another property!)

ok, quickly fixed yesterday's bezier issues!

ok, sprites support multiple images IN THEORY (we haven't tested it yet), most sprite logic seems good (in theory), and getting/generating full states are done! `generateFullSequence()` and `getFullStateAt()` are in `sprite.py`'s `SingleSprite` now!

ok, fixed a couple things through testing, and i can't read this data

![i cannot read this](</updatelogs/images/072024/07012024 - 1.png>)

however, looking at the start and end, it seems like it works, so im just gonna act like it does (i will regret this moment sometime in the future)! anyways, we have to make the image processing now (as in appy properties such as transparency and things)! transparency is done, and theres a lot more to go...

ok, its been a while, brightness was a pain to find out how to work, but the effects should be good now! now, im threw together a little methoed to read a state (basically a single frame of all the full states), and returns the edited image with all the funny changes, given all the images and that single frame/state. i just saw a squirell jump a huge distance, good job squirell! (wait, its spelled squirrel?) anyways, im gonna try to hook up this to the screen, just to see if it works! (note: it currently does not?)

another while later, somethings definetely wrong with coordinate paths, but it seems to FOLLOW it correctly! im just gonna commit here because im gonna do something for a second!

so, i looked at the path and went off to dinner. as i was eating dinner, i was thinking and i suspect that the reason why the path isnt following correctly is because we are reading (time, x) instead of (x, y) because we have (time, x, y) setup somewhere...

in `iterateThroughPath()` from `sprite.py`: 

`path.append((roundf(len(path)/RENDER_FPS, PATH_FLOAT_ACCURACY), coord[0], coord[1]))`

told ya! :D

now testing... YES YSET ITS WOKRING!!! (i am very happy) also, small change, ticks doesn't increase by one every time the interface is ticked, but instead by `round(RENDER_FPS/self.fps)` in order to be more "real time"! now, time to make a more advanced path! great things are coming! (too bad i am forced to be tutored tommorow morning online 9:30AM - 10AM... don't worry, it should be ok!) now, im gonna shower real quick, do some art for an hour, and i'll be right back!
