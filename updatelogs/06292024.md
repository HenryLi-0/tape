# 6/29/2024 - 22nd Update!

ok ok, its currently 12 AM, and i just finished disc 3 of season 3. what's also important is that i thought of how to approach this issue while brushing my teeth. all "animated images", not neccesarily visual objects, but the sprites that move across the screen will have to have a set of "properties" at all times. here's a quick draft of a couple properties:

- position+orientation (x,y,dir)
- effects (transparency, color shift, brightness, etc.)

so we know that it must have some form of this information every animation frame, as like some form of "state". now, this "state" is determined by deafults, and the editor aspect of it, where that modifies the properties. for example, when processing the animation, there can be a path element in the editor from `0 seconds to 2 seconds`, which modifies position and maybe orientation during that time. maybe theres also a transparency effect from `1 second to 3 seconds`, which modifies the transparency during that time frame. the only problem i can currently see with this is multiple events conflicting with each other, which might just show up as red in the editor and prioritize the first one.

now, when the user requests to see a frame of the video, the code should look through the "property modifiers", or, basically, the "editor elements", and basically process what state of properties the sprite should be in at that frame. another benefit of this approach (that, well, now that i think about it, works with other approaches too), is that the elements in the editor don't need to be in order. ok, im going to sleep now, can't wait to get coding tommorow morning! (well, today morning)

so, to simplify this, we have SPRITES that are images that have ELEMENTS (editable in the editor), which modify the STATE/PROPERTIES of the SPRITE in accordance to TIME. now, the images that move around hte screen will not be interactable, just the editor can edit them. also, quickly, before we do this stuff, we should clean up the animation screen. ok, the animation portion is empty now, and the helpful text stuff is now temporarily moved into the timeline portion (it's only there temporarily!)

ok, so the current UI plan is to have the editor have movable rectangular elements for the paths and follow things, but i am also considering using a graph based UI, where one axis is a property and the other is time. the benefit of this is that it would be easier to code the properties, as it is a literal graph, but the other version just requires searching through ELEMENTS. it would be more clear to the user what's going on, but it may be tricky/unclear for paths. afater sitting and thinking about it, i think we should stick with the original plan, but keep this graph UI in consideration later. wait, i just realized another benefit of the graph approach, the ability to create advanced "paths" for effects, for example, a non-linear size change. 

also, the ELEMENTS will show up in the VISUALS tab! (just to clarify!)

here's more effects i think would be rather useful:
- size
- color shift
- transparency
- brightness
- pixelation

here's the redesign of the editor tab in visual mode!

![oo look, agraph!](</updatelogs/images/06292024 - 1.png>)

basically, you can click on lines and set them to straight or curved and edit the curve, (of course with max 1 or 100%). now, for paths, it will be a similar editor, but the graph will display velocity/change in position, and the points, when clicked, will show up on the animation as interractable visual orbs. (also, the little bar on the right shows what it is about, transparency is shown.) to also improve productivity, i think it would be smart to assign each one a number, of course, intuitive to me and no one else (just kidding, this will likely be a changable setting)

`sprite.py` is a thing now, you can see the sprite data storage there! here are planned keybinds:
- 1 : path (coords)
- 2 : path (degrees)
- 3 : size
- 4 : color
- 5 : transparency
- 6 : brightness
- 7 : pixelation

ok, when im back, i'll try to make the visual template (you know, the image in the files) for the outlines, and adding the simple UI parts of the section!

unfortunately, instead of planning like he expected, i just fell asleep for the past hour. oops. anyways, template time! now, while my music streaming service is spamming ads at me, i need to think of some iportant logic. so STEPS are basically the FPS, so if there are more seconds, ex. a smooth change across 3 seconds, will have more STEPS into the function compared to less seconds, ex. a smooth change across 1 second. also, the UI template is rendering properly and showing up correctly in the tab!

after getting into a lot of dead ends, i finally found a formula i think i like for this $f\left(x\right)=a+\left(b-a\right)\log_{s}\left(x+1\right)$

ok, `smoothChangeAt()` and `straightChangesAt()` have been added to `pathing.py`!
