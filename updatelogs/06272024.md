# 6/27/2024 - 20th Update!

ok, starting it off strong in the morning, basically, last night, I had this questionably good idea of adding `CODEGUIDE.md` (idk what to call it). basically, its documentation on what each file/directory (well, the important ones) do, for anyone else looking at this and wanting to look into it (and future me who forgot everything about this). 

after this, just a bunch of documentation here and there and removing unnecessary imports (some may be useful?)

now i think its a good idea to create some form of global rendering object system thing where bascially everything that needs to be rendered is rendered and calculated. bascially, this is to fix the issue of what is currently being interracted with, as each screen is kind of acting by themselves right now. also, side note, i thought it was a genius idea to bring my laptop into the bathroom with me so that i can program while sitting on the toilet. it kind of stinks. just like the code structure right now. 

so, side quest: **move everything to something that makes sense**

ok, so, the way this could work is moving every screen into one giant thing, but this is silly, as that requires updating sections that arent even being interracted with (which will contribute to lag)

ok, i got a better idea. 

yes! now, since everything is in a global system for detecting what the user is interacting with, multiple buttons shouldn't be activating at the same time (only one thing should be selected!) (i didn't even try to make the code with multiple buttons activating since that would be a silly amount of repeated code) just in case i forget or you're interested, `self.globalInteractableVisualObjects` contains a list of everything in this format: 

```
[
    ["section","visual object"],
    ["section","visual object"]
]
```

wow, that was a productive hour! i think the next thing is to actual finish the options menu (buttons click but don't actually stay clicked like you would expect a tab system to work (it's currently just a button)) also, im getting really scared as im in the room where i saw that mosquito last night. ive actually started wondering if i was hallucinating...
