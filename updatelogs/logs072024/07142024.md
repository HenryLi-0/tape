# 7/14/2024 - 36th Update

oh look its sunday! which means that tommorow is going to be abosultely packed with random errands and stuff...

to do: 
- 7/13/2024 - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - save projects
- 7/15/2024 - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/16/2024 - exporting projects to video

ok, im gonna finish up with apperance importing! scrolling first! completely unrelated side note, my laptop's fans are burning my legs right now

it seems that x and y are reversed in `setLimitedSize()`, that has been fixed! (resizing to a limited size should work properly now!) just decided that instead of making a fancy system where the yOffset of the apeprances depended on the resized image eight, it should be all equally spaced (it is currently fancy)

ok a bit of projects tab work, some numbers are correct now!

```
x = 90*(i%2)+6
(x-6)/90 = i%2

y = math.floor(i/2)*90-self.apperancePanelOffset
(y-self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 = math.floor(i/2)
math.floor(i/2) = (i-i%2)/2
(y-self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 = (i-i%2)/2
(2*y-2*self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 = i-i%2

(2*y-2*self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 + (x-6)/90 = i

(x+2*y-2*self.apperancePanelOffset-6)/90 = i
```

ok so high quality images lag the whole thing out horribly, deleting images with the keybind apperas to be working, but is a little buggy at the moment (creating is working though!)
