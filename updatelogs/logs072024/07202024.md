# 7/20/2024 - 42nd Update!

good morning its 6:15 AM and it took me 3 attempts to type the time (i dont think i got much sleep yesterday)

ok 7:20 AM and its time to go, changed some random things, textbox is still acting funny...

its 9:30 PM at night and im ignoring messages from my volunteering place (its the weekend, you already take 20+ hours per week! next time youll see me is monday!)

oh know i know why it works, cursed regeneration! anyways, now for changing the UI a little...

ok, reverted and redid some changes, moved things around, and there's sprite name editing! now for some fancy timeline work...
