# 6/30/2024 - 23rd Update!

so, i did forget to pull...

ok, so i think i implemented `iterateThoughSingle()` and `findStateThroughSingle()` in sprite logic for the single 1-1 conenctions, but i'm gonna test it later, once everything is working! now, coordinate paths need to work (just to reiterate, its a bit harder than the simple 1-1 connections that the compact storage will use, as it can connect through multiple coordinates/states for the bezier paths)
