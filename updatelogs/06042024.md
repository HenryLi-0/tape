# 6/4/2024 - Update #1

First update! The repository was made a couple days ago, but I didn't really have anytime to work on it... should probably get started...

Anyways, I did a little math this morning and here's the results:

Yes, I did that in Google Slides. Now, I'm not sure if this is actually Bezier curves, but I think it is, but you get the point. Lets do a little more math together.

Point 1: $(x_{1},y_{1})$

Point 3: $(x_{3},y_{3})$

Line between P1 and P3: $f\left(x\right)=\frac{y_{3}-y_{1}}{x_{3}-x_{1}}\left(x-x_{1}\right)+y_{1}$

Point 2: $(x_{2},y_{2})$

Midpoint of 1 and 3: $\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2},\frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}\right)$

Point A (Point 2 - To Midpoint Vector (idk what to call it)): $\left(2x_{2}-\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2},2y_{2}-\frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}\right)$

Ok, so we got our three points for the curve, 

Point 1: $(x_{1},y_{1})$

Point 3: $(x_{3},y_{3})$

Point A (Point 2 - To Midpoint Vector (idk what to call it)): $\left(2x_{2}-\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}}{2},2y_{2}-\frac{y_{1}+y_{3}}{2}\right)$

Now we have to do the funny Bezier curve maths. This may involve parametric equations???

Line between P1 and P A: $g\left(x\right)=\frac{y_{a}-y_{1}}{x_{a}-x_{1}}\left(x-x_{1}\right)+y_{1}$

Line between P3 and P A: $h\left(x\right)=\frac{y_{a}-y_{3}}{x_{a}-x_{3}}\left(x-x_{3}\right)+y_{3}$

So we need to turn distance (in part of) from each line, set one of the 1-%, and equation, then create a line across

$a_{1}\left(x\right)=x_{1}-x\left(x_{1}-x_{a}\right)$

$b_{1}\left(x\right)=y_{1}-x\left(y_{1}-y_{a}\right)$

$a_{2}\left(x\right)=x_{3}-x\left(x_{3}-x_{a}\right)$

$b_{2}\left(x\right)=y_{3}-x\left(y_{3}-y_{a}\right)$

and here, where u is the percentage

$\left(a_{1}\left(u\right),b_{1}\left(u\right)\right)$

$\left(a_{2}\left(1-u\right),b_{2}\left(1-u\right)\right)$

and all together

$c\left(x\right)=\frac{b_{2}\left(1-u\right)-b_{1}\left(u\right)}{a_{2}\left(1-u\right)-a_{1}\left(u\right)}\left(x-a_{1}\left(u\right)\right)+b_{1}\left(u\right)$

and to see the curve

$u=\left[0,0.1,...,1\right]$

now it just then needs to calculate to intersections of the perecent lines and move across... [here's](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4l7lelmwsg) the desmos calculator with all this stuff! (it looks really good, try moving some points!)

now, code implementation... ahh
