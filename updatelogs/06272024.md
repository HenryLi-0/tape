# 6/27/2024 - 20th Update!

ok, starting it off strong in the morning, basically, last night, I had this questionably good idea of adding `CODEGUIDE.md` (idk what to call it). basically, its documentation on what each file/directory (well, the important ones) do, for anyone else looking at this and wanting to look into it (and future me who forgot everything about this). 

after this, just a bunch of documentation here and there and removing unnecessary imports (some may be useful?)
