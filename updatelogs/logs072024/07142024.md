# 7/14/2024 - 36th Update

oh look its sunday! which means that tommorow is going to be abosultely packed with random errands and stuff...

to do: 
- 7/13/2024 - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - save projects
- 7/15/2024 - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/16/2024 - exporting projects to video

ok, im gonna finish up with apperance importing! scrolling first! completely unrelated side note, my laptop's fans are burning my legs right now

it seems that x and y are reversed in `setLimitedSize()`, that has been fixed! (resizing to a limited size should work properly now!) just decided that instead of making a fancy system where the yOffset of the apeprances depended on the resized image eight, it should be all equally spaced (it is currently fancy)

ok a bit of projects tab work, some numbers are correct now!

```
x = 90*(i%2)+6
(x-6)/90 = i%2

y = math.floor(i/2)*90-self.apperancePanelOffset
(y-self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 = math.floor(i/2)
math.floor(i/2) = (i-i%2)/2
(y-self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 = (i-i%2)/2
(2*y-2*self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 = i-i%2

(2*y-2*self.apperancePanelOffset)/90 + (x-6)/90 = i

(x+2*y-2*self.apperancePanelOffset-6)/90 = i
```

ok so high quality images lag the whole thing out horribly, deleting images with the keybind apperas to be working, but is a little buggy at the moment (creating is working though!)

![oh](</updatelogs/images/072024/07142024 - 1.png>)

~~oh its that number~~ anyways, im not really sure about the `savestate()` and `close()` functions/methoeds in `interface.py`... they might be useful?

ok, `CacheManager` has been hooked up to everything i can think of in `interface.py` that is related. it should hopefully work, but we'll never know till we test it! wow crash! now its not an instant crash, but still a crash! ok, not crashing and no 5000 random files, lets try importing! seems to be working nicely! hopefully its working correctly!

now for something that should have happened a LONG time ago, adding a play button. oops fell asleep, where was i?

ok, the play/pause button is now working and should be close to real time! thats great!

remember that one log from 6/18/2024 where i wrote about how to structure this save? well, look how it helps... it still had the idea of a non-graph based UI (drag and drop idea), so it needs some revisions

```
project = [
    { #project
        "project name": "example",
        "UUID" : "some uuid",
        "other stats and stuff": "things"
    },
    { #spritedata
        "sprite name": {
            "name": "test", 
            "images": [imageUUIDs], 
            "c":[0,(0,0),"L",1,(0,0),"L"],
            "r":[0,    0,"L",1,    0,"L"],
            "a":[0,    0,"L",1,    0,"L"],
            "s":[0,   50,"L",1,   50,"L"],
            "h":[0,    0,"L",1,    0,"L"],
            "t":[0,  100,"L",1,  100,"L"],
            "b":[0,   50,"L",1,   50,"L"],
            "w":[0,    0,"L",1,    0,"L"] 
        }
    },
    {  #image data IF the user wants to export it together (otherwise, these images will not exist!)
        "some uuid": "some numpy array",
        "some uuid": "some numpy array",
        "some uuid": "some numpy array",
        "some uuid": "some numpy array",
        "some uuid": "some numpy array"
    }
]
```
looks familiar (that sprite data)? thats because the data is actually from `sprite.py`, in the same structure. its like i planned this out! (i, in fact, did not plan this out. i, in fact, do not plan things out very well half the time. the other half of the time i pull out the flowcharts. speaking of which, that gave me an idea...)

anyways, packing time! (not literally, but quite literally)

ok, lets try to see if it works! seems to be good! the numpy file's binary data has been replaced with an "a" as it is visably shown to fill up the terminal with the funny symbols and numbers and letters

![woo!](</updatelogs/images/072024/07142024 - 2.png>)

yes! now we just export to a given file, which we still need to think about. this is working nicely! infact, i could probably write importing right now... hold on...

ok, i think im about to be forced to go to sleep, so good night everyone! i plan on editing a youtube video for the first half of the tutoring session (i am tutoring) (of course, when its not my turn to teach!) and probably work on this the other half! good night!

to-do:
- 7/13/2024 - DONE - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - DONE-ish - save projects
- 7/15/2024 - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/16/2024 - exporting projects to video

oh right, we need to find out where to save these projects!
