# 8/18/2024 - 47th Update!

ok, this should (ideally) be the last day on optimizations? there isnt too much to change (other than maybe limiting updates to sections to "not every tick"? (for example, sprites should not update unless the number os sprites has changed or when the sprite selection has changed, or the offset has changed))

anyways, the optimizations did (certainly) break the path showing up, so probably should fix that now... ok, finally found the bit of code that does the screen path stuff! ok, the code is in a bit of a strange position. currently, the old path stuff uses the old code, where the entire screen was not in regions, and calculates it like that. i guess i can solve the issue of "calculating huge paths for every region is unnecessary" by adding a caclulation function?

ok, it might work, but we cant tell until we start scheduling the regions! part of me wants to be lazy and schedule all regions, but i also only want to update the regions that are involved with it, but it might be easier (and maybe faster) to just schedule all instead of calculating each point's region area (which will probably take forever for huge paths). basically, im trying to say i should probably schedule all the regions

huh, nothings appearing?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08182024 - 1.png>)

somethings quite wrong...

ok, i just realized, this was a bad idea. a smart idea would have been to calculate this all on a screen, then make each region grab a region from this screen and overlay that on top! ok, this change has been made and it works now! great! just kidding, i just realized that this undoes the optimization because it makes a copy of the entire screen array when processing (unnecesary), oops

should be fixed? ok, just realized that the timeline does not need to be grabbing and calculating the sizes of each time bar (aka, fancy timeline) every single tick, and same with the sprites tab!
