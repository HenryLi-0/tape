# 6/15/2024 - 9th Update!

Update 9! Can't believe how slow I am at developing this! :p So, what happened? Well, I'm supposed to be tutoring students, but multitasking is cool and its not my turn to teach yet. Anyways, did a little editing with the UI concept, not many changes, just a bit of squishing.

So, programming related stuff now: Basically, a bunch of moving around and preparing for the hard part, which is the actual UI. It should work in a way that all UI related imagery processing will come from `interface.py`. We also now have a test loading image! (Yes, I drew that as a reference to something, as I stated last update log... if you know, you know)

Anyways, time to do more preperation the UI!

Ok, it's the afternoon. After consulting with ChatGPT, it agrees it is a good idea to convert the images to matrixes to do math on them. With this, we basically had to make our own code to "paste" the second image on top of the other one, and I have noticed many `:3` in my code:

Anyways, yes, disclaimer, ChatGPT did help a bit with fixing some parts of `pasteOverlay`, as I am a bit tired right now (don't worry, I tested the final product and it seems to work!) (please dont steal my job) 

Ok, now it's even later, I should be practicing drawing right now... Anyways, after even more changes (this time with the help of ChatGPT), the whole thing doesn't crash when attempting to overlay an image offscreen! (like when the entire image would be offscreen) Anyways, now, enjoy 8 copies of a little doodle spread across with the background of a larger doodle. Enjoy! Also, the whole thing seems to support transparency, but it's a little weird with a transparent background. To solve this in the next versions, everything will probably be overlayed on top of an array with the display size, so there should be no weird transparency issues and everything will be on the screen.

If you don't want to load this version of the project to view it, here's an image of what it can do! (ignore the bits of VSCode on the side...)

Also, that reminds me to rename to window from "test" to the actual name...
