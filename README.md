# Tape

## Note:

Tape just had its first real release! There'll probably be tons of bugs, so create an issue if you find any!

## Goal:

Issue: No editing software I have can easily move solid images around the screen

**Normal Solution:** Download an editing software with this capability and test it out

**My Solution:** Decide to make a video editor

One option is clearly better here, you decide which... (clearly the second one) (joke) (not really)

Ok, time to get started!

### Images:

You can also find a video of it [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hZ3eRs_Sic)

### Getting Started:

First, make sure you have all the neccesary python modules installed to run this! (Any modules that don't come with python are listed below!) Then, either clone this repository, or download a recent release (either v1 or v1.1) from the releases tab, and run [`main.py`](/main.py)! Check [`MANUAL.md`](/MANUAL.md) for a longer user manual on how to use this, and check [`CODEGUIDE.md`](/CODEGUIDE.md) if you're interested in where to find code!

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
- cv2 (openCV2)
