# 7/16/2024 - 38th Update

as i have to teach and tutor a kid every single day and do a bunch of teaching stuff, my will to live is slowly decreasing (no way i spent 3.5 hours this afternoon on youtube before realizing it)

hows everyone doing? hopefully well! its coding time! ok, theres now a save button and a place to save, and a screen that pops up to save! thats great!

![strange data](</updatelogs/images/072024/07162024 - 1.png>)

ok, its been a while, connected saving to the interface with a new save button icon!

the load button icon may look a little familiar... (yes, i flipped the arrow upside down. or right side up?) loading might be good, just need to wire things up. ok, all wired up! testing... saving is working... oh loading crashed... three more crashes and we just loaded in! yes! now its bug hunting time...

wow found a path bug with single connection linear paths... its not even tommorow yet! also fixed a bunch of canceling saving/loading crashes

ok, testing loading a more advanced one with images this time! ok, succesfully loaded, now lets try without the cached image... and it loads and regenerates the cached photo! great! but just to make sure, how about loading an image thats deleted from my computer? and a crash! ok, fixed some stuff, and it seems to be working now! the project data can also bring in the image data now! that's great! unfortunately, my computer may run out of charge soon, and im being told to go to sleep, so bug hunting will continue tommorow!

to-do:
- 7/13/2024 - DONE - apperance importing 
- 7/14/2024 - DONE - save projects
- 7/16/2024 - DONE - open projects and bug fixing
- 7/17/2024 - exporting projects to video
- 7/18/2024 - polish up and UI stuff
- 7/19/2024 - hopefully release?

uh oh... exporting video time... good night!

quick update, i just got scared from my computer getting stuck on the loading windows screen, that was weird... (im on github mobile now) i think that for exporting video, exporting to gif and exporting to a video should be an option. its probably also gonna be in the projects tab, just a button that says "render". anyways, gotta find out how to export to video in a way that i like... good night!
