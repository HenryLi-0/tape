# 6/30/2024 - 23rd Update!

so, i did forget to pull...

ok, so i think i implemented `iterateThoughSingle()` and `findStateThroughSingle()` in sprite logic for the single 1-1 conenctions, but i'm gonna test it later, once everything is working! now, coordinate paths need to work (just to reiterate, its a bit harder than the simple 1-1 connections that the compact storage will use, as it can connect through multiple coordinates/states for the bezier paths)

ive been forced to go outside

anyways, now that im back home, its time to program `iterateThroughPath()` and `findStateThroughPath()`! debugging this one will be a pain!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/06302024 - 1.png>)  ![well that was painful](</updatelogs/images/06302024 - 2.png>)

well, it seems to work now! `iterateThroughPath()` seems good, now its `findStateThroughPath()` time and time to implement these functions/methoeds into the sprite object! now, while planning on finishing that, i realized that whenever bezier paths were used that required some sense of time, `bezierPathCoords()` doesn't really care. it only cares about the steps between each, but that's constant the entire time. so, introducing a new function/methoed, `timelyBezierPathCoords()`!

ok, now that that's implemented properly, gonna add a couple docs and acutally get to what i was planning (`timelyBezierPathCoords()` took much longer than expected!)

![yay](</updatelogs/images/06302024 - 3.png>)

ok, docs added, back on track! (i'm gonna quickly push with an incomplete `findStateThroughPath()` as i think my brain is a little fried now)
