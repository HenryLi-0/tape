- 7/17/2024 - exporting projects to video
- 7/18/2024 - polish up and UI stuff
- 7/19/2024 - hopefully release?

uhhh i dont want to do video exporting... but i have to. ok, im gonna distract myself by drawing the button's icon! im gonna quickly add those in...

wow, my computer's handling a video conference, vscode, two browsers (37 tabs total) and a music app at the same time... that's insane!

ok, so i found out that openCV does, in fact, export to .avi, which supports alpha channel transparency, and can open here on windows! that's great! ok, playing around with it, and it seems that i need to write some code to make all the images the same size...

ok, turns out ive been scammed and it doesn't support aplha channel transparency? whats happening??? ok so ive been scammed and opencv doesnt export with alpha channel transparency??? what is my research (chatgpt) saying? ok seems like nothing's working, that's great! (ok im spending way too long, but i don't think we can export with transparency?)

ok im gonna push, but its not working yet (we need to detect the last point because the video needs to know when to end)
