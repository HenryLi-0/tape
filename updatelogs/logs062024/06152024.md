# 6/15/2024 - 9th Update!

Update 9! Can't believe how slow I am at developing this! :p So, what happened? Well, I'm supposed to be tutoring students, but multitasking is cool and its not my turn to teach yet. Anyways, did a little editing with the UI concept, not many changes, just a bit of squishing.

So, programming related stuff now: Basically, a bunch of moving around and preparing for the hard part, which is the actual UI. It should work in a way that all UI related imagery processing will come from `interface.py`. We also now have a test loading image! (Yes, I drew that as a reference to something, as I stated last update log... if you know, you know)

Anyways, time to do more preperation the UI!

Ok, it's the afternoon. After consulting with ChatGPT, it agrees it is a good idea to convert the images to matrixes to do math on them. With this, we basically had to make our own code to "paste" the second image on top of the other one, and I have noticed many `:3` in my code:

Anyways, yes, disclaimer, ChatGPT did help a bit with fixing some parts of `pasteOverlay`, as I am a bit tired right now (don't worry, I tested the final product and it seems to work!) (please dont steal my job) 

Ok, now it's even later, I should be practicing drawing right now... Anyways, after even more changes (this time with the help of ChatGPT), the whole thing doesn't crash when attempting to overlay an image offscreen! (like when the entire image would be offscreen) Anyways, now, enjoy 8 copies of a little doodle spread across with the background of a larger doodle. Enjoy! Also, the whole thing seems to support transparency, but it's a little weird with a transparent background. To solve this in the next versions, everything will probably be overlayed on top of an array with the display size, so there should be no weird transparency issues and everything will be on the screen.

If you don't want to load this version of the project to view it, here's an image of what it can do! (ignore the bits of VSCode on the side...)

Also, that reminds me to rename to window from "test" to the actual name...

A little testing later, we're getting (for one place over of PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE and PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE2 at (450,450)) is `1000 tests | avg: 0.004386024713516235 seconds`, which is about 228 times per second

To be extra sure, (since this is EXTREMELY important), here's a test with it being placed once at random positions (including partially off the screen and fully off the screen (up to 10 pixels)) `1000 tests | avg: 0.004143877744674683 seconds`, which isn't a huge difference, just about 241 times per second, likely due to not needing to render some of the offscreen images. Here are the results! `1000 tests | avg: 0.03634105658531189 seconds`, around 27.5 times per second. Now, this is REALLY bad, as it's now super slow. 

Now, for the final test, same things as the 2nd test, but this time, we are running the `placeOver()` a total of 10 times and running `arrayToImage()` 1 time. (this is because in reality, it only needs to be converted to an image at the end)

Ok, it seems that we've isolated the main issue pretty quickly. It appears that converting images to numpy is very slow, as running `img1 = numpy.array(PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE)` (the 512x512 image) 10 times had a result of `1000 tests | avg: 0.022793052196502687 seconds`, which is about 44 times per second.

Now, I have sacrificed a lot of things for faster speeds. The code is way less readable, and everything coming in should already be a numpy array. Then, I realized something. We shouldn't need to copy and spit out a new array everytime, we should modify an original array, and do all the maths on that, so we only have to copy from the base array (background and stuff) once per tick. `1000 tests | avg: 0.012481947183609008 seconds`, which is about 80 times per second.

Ok, it's around 3 times faster. Still pretty slow, so we really need to figure out how to calculate this more efficiently. Here are the restraints already created by the optimizations:
- All images must be put in as a numpy array
- One of the inputs are edited, nothing is returned
- Takes about 0.0012 seconds per overlay, which is pretty fast when you first look at it, but we need to do multiple of these per frame, which will have to be at least 30-60 per second

Well, all these tests are with the 512x512 and 100x100 images, how about smaller resolutions? 128x128 and 16x16 time!

As expected, lightning fast speeds: `1000 tests | avg: 0.0007084679603576661 seconds` This means that it is a possible option to sacrifice resolution for speed, but I think the user can choose that one.

Ok, so we learned that: 
- We should convert all images into numpy arrays before using them
- Computing large image overlays is expensive, may be smarter to compute smaller part overlays and combine them in the end
- im decent at drawing?

Anyways, that's it for today! I'm going to have to wake up early tommorow for some doctor's appointment, so tommorow's update may be a little later. Hey, look at the time: 11:55 PM here in NYC!
