# Tape

An Overly Unnecessary Editor To Animate An Image To Move Across Your Screen.

## Note:

Tape (yes, it stand for something silly) is still under development and is planned to have a (hopefully) test release before the end of July (if not july, hopefully by the end of august...)! Unfortunately, contributions are not being accepted until it has an actual ready release (i plan on changing a lot of code and do frequently get ideas at 1 AM) and is suitable for testing. However, don't hesitate to report any bugs! 

(Note: As of June 2024, it will likely be broken half the time and everything is currently a bit of a mess...)

## Goal:

Issue: No editing software I have can easily move solid images around the screen

**Normal Solution:** Download an editing software with this capability and test it out

**My Solution:** Decide to make a video editor

One option is clearly better here, you decide which... (clearly the second one) (joke) (not really)

Ok, time to get started!

### A couple things to do:

- Smooth Paths
- Simple Rotation (not moving)
- Paths with Rotation (moving)
- Particles (explode, confetti, and other effects)
- Simple GUI (options, timing, etc.) (probably block/node based)
- Simple GUI (for paths) (bezier points, path editor)
- Fancy GUI (graphs, lines, etc.)
- Some silly logo
- this is a really silly idea

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
- cv2 (openCV2)
