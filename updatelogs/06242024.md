Ok, we really need to speed up development! Quickly, share the updates!

The dangerous version of `placeOver()` has been added! You've been warned! (just kidding, its not too dangerous) It's meant to be used to overlay things on black/empty regions of textures. Now, it seems decently fast/ok (for `dPlaceOver(FRAME_ANIMATION_ARRAY, MISSING_IMAGE_ARRAY,(100,100))`, test results are: `1000 tests | avg: 0.0048579139709472655 seconds`)

`bezierPathCoords()` got a small update, instead of setting the first midpoint position to the first point, it is now the average of the first two points.

Here's a little test about FPS and images on the screen! Overlaying smaller images are less expensive than larger images. However, it seems that the reason is just that editing pixels takes time (well, obviously), but the relationship MIGHT be proportional (that is, between pixels updated and FPS).
